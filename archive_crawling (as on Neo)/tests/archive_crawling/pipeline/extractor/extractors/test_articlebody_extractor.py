        Topics Walt Disney|Walmart|US politics Reuters | NEW YORK/WASHINGTON Last Updated at January 13, 2021 09:12 IST https://mybs.in/2ZbHU2q  By Jessica DiNapoli and David Shepardson NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Walmart Inc, the world's biggest retailer and Walt Disney Co joined other major companies in indefinitely suspending donations to U.S. lawmakers who voted against President-elect Joe Biden's election certification. The Arkansas-based company said on Tuesday that in light of last week's attack on the U.S. Capitol, its "political action committee is indefinitely suspending contributions to those members of Congress who voted against the lawful certification of state electoral college votes." Disney, the entertainment company, said in a statement that in the "immediate aftermath of that appalling siege, members of Congress had an opportunity to unite - an opportunity that some sadly refused to embrace. In light of these events, we have decided we will not make political contributions in 2021 to lawmakers who voted to reject the certification of the Electoral College votes." Other blue-chip companies including AT&T Inc, Amazon.com Inc and Mastercard Inc announced similar moves in the past several days. General Motors Co said on Tuesday it had paused all political contributions after the Capitol events. It joined other firms such as JPMorgan Chase & Co, Alphabet Inc's Google and Union Pacific Corp in withholding contributions from all members of Congress, rather than targeting those who opposed Biden's certification. The announcements indicate that some corporate donors, which usually give money to Republicans and Democrats alike, are reassessing their strategy after supporters of outgoing Republican President Donald Trump attacked the Capitol last week, aiming to prevent Congress from certifying Biden's win. Five people died, including a police officer. Before the assault on the seat of Congress, Trump urged supporters to march to the Capitol to protest the Nov. 3 election results, which he has falsely claimed were "rigged." When lawmakers reconvened after the incident, 147 Republicans in the House of Representatives and Senate voted to challenge the Democratic president-elect's victory in Pennsylvania or Arizona, even though both states already formally certified the results and election officials say there were no significant problems with the vote. It is unclear whether the companies' decisions will have a lasting impact. The time period immediately after an election is typically a lull for fundraising activity.

        Topics Donald Trump impeachment|Donald Trump|US Capitol attack ANI | US Last Updated at January 13, 2021 09:17 IST https://mybs.in/2ZbHU25  US House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday (local time) issued a 76-page compiled report supporting the impeachment of President Donald Trump on "incitement of insurrection" charges following a riot in the Capitol. According to the report, "Some have argued that given the little remaining time left in President Trump's term, there is no need to impeach him now. This ignores the precedent this country would set if we refuse to impeach and the remedy of disqualification that the Senate may impose." "President Trump committed the impeachable offense of incitement of insurrection by willfully making statements that, in context, encouraged and foreseeably resulted in lawless action at the Capitol," it noted. "He set the stage for the Capitol attack in the months leading up to January 6th, and on that date, he exhorted the mob into a frenzy, aimed it like a loaded gun down Pennsylvania Avenue, and pulled the trigger," it highlighted while accusing Trump of "falsely asserting he won the 2020 presidential election and repeatedly seeking to overturn" its results. "President Trump committed a high Crime and Misdemeanor against the Nation by inciting an insurrection at the Capitol in an attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 Presidential Election. The facts establish that he is unfit to remain in office a single day longer, and warrant the immediate impeachment of President Trump," the report stated. On January 6, a group of Trump's loyalists stormed the US Capitol building, clashing with police, damaging property, seizing the inauguration stage and occupying the rotunda. The unrest took place after Trump urged his supporters to protest what he claims is a stolen presidential election. The outgoing President has since been blocked on all major social networks at least until after he is out of office.

        Topics China economy Reuters | WASHINGTON Last Updated at January 13, 2021 01:38 IST https://mybs.in/2ZbHU0Y  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Increasing debt distress in emerging markets means that China, now the world's largest official creditor, will need to start restructuring debts in the same way that Paris Club lenders did in past crises, World Bank Chief Economist Carmen Reinhart told the Reuters Next conference on Tuesday. "What I think China will need to do to confront this is what previous other creditors in the past had done, which is you have to restructure. And restructure big time, meaning either lower interest rates, longer maturities, write-off in principal or some combination of that," Reinhart said in a panel discussion on economic inequality. She said that during the COVID-19 pandemic, China would need to take on a "new role" that has been an "old role" for Paris Club lenders, as Beijing is now facing for the first time wider spreads and difficulties in countries' ability to service debt on a broad scale.

        Topics Milky Way|Galaxy|ISRO Shibu Tripathi | New Delhi Last Updated at January 13, 2021 13:06 IST https://mybs.in/2ZbHU93  The Milky Way Galaxy that houses Earth is just over 13 billion years old. Still, in its youth, the galaxy has several billion years more to go. However, not all galaxies are that lucky. Astronomers have now discovered a dying galaxy as it loses its ability to form new stars. The merging galaxy formed 4.5 billion years ago is dubbed ID2299 and is ejecting gases equivalent to 10,000 Suns-worth of gas a year, rapidly losing its fuel core. The research published in Nature Astronomy titled A titanic interstellar medium ejection from a massive starburst galaxy" suggests that the event was triggered by a galactic collision between two galaxies nine billion years into the past. Annagrazia Puglisi, lead researcher on the study, from the Durham University said that This is the first time we have observed a typical massive star-forming galaxy in the distant universe about to die because of a massive cold gas ejection." The university in a statement said that the rate at which the gas is being expelled from ID2299 is too high to have been caused by the energy created by a black hole or starburst as seen in previous studies.  Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) a state-of-the-art telescope to study light from some of the coldest objects in the Universe.  The new observation was done by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). According to the European Southern Observatory, "the clue that pointed the scientists towards this scenario was the association of the ejected gas with a tidal tail." The tidal tails, according to scientists, are streams of stars and gas extending into interstellar space that result when two galaxies merge and are largely faint in appearance. ALSO READ: How did water originate on Earth? Data from asteroid Ryugu deepen mystery  Most astronomers believe that winds caused by star formation and the activity of black holes at the centres of massive galaxies are responsible for launching star-forming material into space, thus ending galaxies ability to make new stars. The study maintains that the observations provide compelling evidence that this is not a feedback-driven wind, but rather material from a merger that has been probably tidally ejected. Our study suggests that gas ejections can be produced by mergers and that winds and tidal tails can appear very similar, the observatory quoted study co-author Emanuele Daddi of CEA-Saclay as saying. This might lead us to revise our understanding of how galaxies die, Daddi adds. According to the team, the discovery was made by chance while they were studying the dataset of galaxies observed by ALMA to study the properties of cold gas in more than 100 far-away galaxies. Witnessing such a massive disruption event adds an important piece to the complex puzzle of galaxy evolution, the team added. The team will now explore the connections between the stars and gas in ID2299, shedding new light on how galaxies evolve.

        A visitor tries a plant-based meat substitute product at the Restaurant & Bar and Gourmet Asia expo at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition centre in Hong Kong on November 11, 2020. Peter Parks | AFP | Getty Images SINGAPORE Demand for meat alternatives has grown and will continue to rise, but the industry still has hurdles to overcome in different parts of the world, analysts said. Worldwide search interest for the term "plant-based meat" skyrocketed in early 2019 months before Beyond Meat's initial public offering, according to Google Trends. The global meat substitutes sector is worth $20.7 billion, and is set to grow to $23.2 billion by 2024, market research company Euromonitor told CNBC. That growth is being spurred by concerns ranging from animal welfare to food security and the Covid-19 pandemic. "In this era of shocks and instability, building a low-risk value chain means focusing on where the opportunities are, and the shift towards plant-based meat shows no signs of slowing down," said Elaine Siu, managing director of The Good Food Institute Asia Pacific. But obstacles remain for the burgeoning market. Cultural barriers The plant-based meat market in Asia may be limited by established perception issues, said Siu. For example, mock meat or vegetarian meat was previously primarily eaten by followers of Buddhism in China, she said. "Replication of the taste and texture of meat was never pushed past a relatively basic level," she said, adding that these traditional products serve a specific purpose and "their appeal is viewed as limited" to certain groups. "In order for plant-based meat to reach its full market potential in Asia, the sector must continue to break free of its association with traditional mock meats, which are expected to be sold at a low price point and carry historical image baggage," said Siu. Objections from the traditional meat industry Cattle farmers could also stand in the way of the alternative protein sector, especially in the U.S., said Simon Powell, global head of thematic research at American bank Jefferies. The U.S. Cattlemen's Association in 2018 filed a petition asking for an official definition of the terms "beef" and "meat," in a bid to keep plant-based proteins out of the description. A herd of beef cattle gather in the shade of old barn on May 4, 2020 in Owings, Maryland. Mark Wilson | Getty Images News | Getty Images "Incumbent producers are going to lobby their governments hard to change the labelling, to mess around with consumer advertising to say you can't call it meat," Powell told CNBC via Zoom. "I think that's potentially one of the biggest barriers." The European Union in October rejected proposals to ban restaurants and shops from using words such as sausage or burger when describing meat alternatives. Consumer confidence, consumer fatigue Powell added that if any of the plant-based meat companies had "some kind of accident" or problem with their recipe that results in a "massive recall," that could make customers afraid of eating these alternatives. "This is a big 'if' but if they were to have a big recall of product, then that might dent consumer confidence," he said. "At some point, you're going to get these events. That's going to set the industry back a bit." Separately, Powell said the "Instagrammability" of plant-based food is one reason why the market is growing "everywhere in the world." Growth of the market could be hindered if the novelty of meat alternatives fades away or wears off, he said.

        CNBC contributor Ben White told the "The News with Shepard Smith" that lawmakers from both sides of the aisle want to see President Donald Trump sign the critical Covid stimulus and government funding bill, as millions of Americans are on the brink of losing their unemployment benefits. "I think a lot of people both within the White House and in the Republican party on Capitol Hill, as well as Democrats, hope that he [President Trump] calms down and simply signs the bill very quietly, and doesn't say anything about it," said White, who is also Politico's chief economic correspondent. Lawmakers from both parties have urged Trump to sign the bill as is. "The best way out of this is for the president to sign the bill, and I still hope that's what he decides to do," Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo. "It took us a long time to get to where we are, I think reopening that bill would be a mistake." House Majority Leader Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., appealed to the president's pathos. "Surely, the president of the United States, whether he's in Mar-a-Lago or anyplace else, ought to empathize with the pain and suffering and apprehension and deep angst that the American people are feeling this Christmas Eve and sign this bill," said Hoyer. Trump, however, has threatened to not sign the Covid-19 relief deal as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., calls his bluff and has sent the bill anyway. A senior Senate Republican aide told NBC News that the bill was being flown to Palm Beach, Florida, where Trump is spending Christmas. White explained that there "could be" enough support to override a veto from Trump and said that the Senate is the wildcard. "The Senate is the question where Republicans are in control and traditionally don't love to block things that the president wants or to reject him in any significant way," White said. "This could be different, because Republicans really want this signed and done with, and, as we know, Trump is a lame duck president." One of the president's demands included bigger stimulus checks of $2,000 instead of $600. House Democrats tried to approve the larger payments on Christmas Eve, but Republican lawmakers blocked it. White noted that the debate over larger stimulus checks creates a complicated political situation in the Georgia U.S. Senate races for Republicans Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue. "Plenty of Georgians, Republicans included, would like to see these larger checks," said White. "The Republican candidates there are not necessarily in favor of them, but it puts them in an awkward position, particularly now that Trump is on record saying he wants bigger stimulus checks."

        Joe Bidenand President Donald Trump delivered starkly different Christmas messages Friday, with the president-elect emphasizing in avideothe pain that theCovid-19 pandemichas wrought and reminding Americans of "our common humanity," while Trump made only the faintest reference to the coronavirus. "Jill and I wish you and your family peace, joy, health and happiness this season. But we know for so many of you in our nation this has been a very difficult year," Biden said in a video message with his wife. "And we're reminded in this season of hope, our common humanity, and what we're called to do for one another." "Many of our fellow Americans are struggling to find work, literally put food on the table, pay their rent or their mortgage, reminded we're on this earth to care for one another, to give what we can and to be a source of help and hope to friends and strangers alike," Biden added. He also emphasized that he and Jill Biden wouldn't be seeing extended family this year, to honor the public health guidelines made necessary by the pandemic. "For the Bidens, we usually have 20 to 25 people over Christmas Eve for dinner, but not this year," the president-elect said. "We're going to miss our family, but it's what we need to do to keep our families safe. We hope you'll consider limiting travel in the size of family gatherings as well this year."

        Lawsuits are coming. Dominion Voting Systems, one of the targets of President Donald Trump's baseless conspiracy theories about the election that he lost, has warned Fox News, major Fox personalities, other conservative media outlets, radio host Rush Limbaugh and conservative lawyers that defamation litigation against them is "imminent." The voting machine company this week has sent 21 letters to the White House, Fox News, its hosts Sean Hannity, Lou Dobbs, Maria Bartiromo, the news outlets Newsmax, One America News Network, Epoch Times and others demanding they stop making defamatory claims about Dominion and that they preserve any documents they have relating to the firm. "We write to provide formal notice that litigation regarding these issues is imminent," Dominion's lawyers Thomas Clare and Megan Meier wrote to Fox News Media General Counsel Lily Fu Claffee in one of the letters, which were provided to CNBC. In their letters to individual news hosts, including Bartiromo, a former CNBC employee, the lawyers demanded that they "cease and desist making defamatory claims against Dominion," saying that they had "featured and continue to feature the proponents of this misinformation campaign against" the company. Others who have received similar letters warning of coming litigation and demands for document preservation include Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani; attorney L. Lin Wood, who has challenged the presidential election results in Georgia, and Newsmax anchor Greg Kelly. A Fox News spokeswoman, when asked for commented, pointed to two segments that aired on Fox News last month. In one, a Dominion spokesman told host Eric Shawn that no significant electronic fraud or tampering occurred on the company's voting machine, and that Trump's claims about the company were false. The spokesman noted that printed ballots from the machines had matched the electronic tallies. In the second segment, host Tucker Carlson at length detailed his staff's efforts to get former federal prosecutor Sidney Powell, who at the time was on Trump's election challenge team, to provide evidence of her controversial claims about Dominion. "But she never sent us any evidence, despite a lot of polite requests," Carlson said in the segment. Spokesmen for the other targets of Dominion's legal letters did not immediately respond to requests for comment. During an interview Thursday on CNN, Dominion CEO John Poulos said the company would be taking legal action against several people "promoting lies and amplifying those lies ... on various media platforms since Election Day." "We will not be overlooking anybody," Poulos said, when asked if the company would sue Trump. Trump, since losing the national popular vote to Joe Biden by more than 7 million votes, has promoted a series of false claims to argue that he won the election in a landslide, and that ballots for him were fraudulently suppressed, while votes for Biden were artificially added in a handful of states where the results were particularly close. On Nov. 12, just nine days after Election Day, Trump tweeted a claim that "DOMINION DELETED 2.7 MILLION TRUMP VOTES NATIONWIDE." One of the most ardent proponents of the conspiracy theories about Dominion has been Powell, who last month was booted from the team of lawyers working for Trump's campaign to overturn Biden's win because her extreme claims were being widely criticized. Since last week, Powell has met with Trump at least once and visited the White House three times in connection with her efforts. Dominion's lawyers have also sent Powell a letter warning of defamation claims. In his interview with CNN, Poulos said Powell's claims that his company's voting machine features software created "at the direction" of the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, a boogeyman for right-wing media, and that Dominion has links to the Clinton Foundation and George Soros are "complete lies." Dominion's security director, Eric Coomer, sued the Trump campaign, Giuliani, Powell and a number of conservative media outlets. Coomer's suit says that he has become the target of death threats and other harmful communications because of the defendants' false claims made about Dominion's machines. On its website, Dominion has said that "disinformation" about the company represents a threat to democracy. "Baseless claims about the integrity of the system or the accuracy of the results have been dismissed by election authorities, subject matter experts and third-party fact-checkers," the company says. "Malicious and misleading false claims about Dominion have resulted in dangerous levels of threats and harassment against the company and its employees, as well as election officials." Last week, another voting machine company, Smartmatic, said that it had issued legal notices and retraction demand letters to Fox News, Newsmax and OAN "for publishing false and defamatory statements." "The demand letters identify dozens of factually inaccurate statements made by each of the organizations as part of a 'disinformation campaign' to injure Smartmatic and discredit the 2020 U.S. election," the company said at the time. "Smartmatic had nothing to do with the "controversies" that certain public and private figures have alleged regarding the 2020 U.S. election," the company said. "Multiple fact-checkers have consistently debunked these false statements with stunning consistency and regularity." Smartmatic said that despite false claims to the contrary, the company's "only involvement in the United States in the 2020 election was as the manufacturing partner, system integrator, and software developer for Los Angeles County's publicly owned voting system."

        Can a nostalgia-packed superhero flick convince people to leave their couches and head to the cinemas? "Wonder Woman 1984" seeks to answer that question. Movie theater owners are hopeful that the "Wonder Woman" sequel, which arrives Christmas Day, will lure a key demographic back to cinemas despite continued surges in coronavirus cases. But, the ongoing pandemic isn't their only concern. On the same day that "Wonder Woman 1984" debuts on the big screen, it will also be available to stream on HBO Max. "'Wonder Woman 1984' represents the first test of a simultaneous big screen/small screen release of a title of this magnitude," said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore. Box office analysts have mixed opinions about how well the film will perform at the domestic box office. "Wonder Woman 1984" underperformed last weekend in its international debut, hauling in around $38.5 million. This was well below the $60 million that the industry had forecast. The film could face even more difficulties in the U.S. and Canada considering only around 34% of theaters are open. That's about 2,000 theaters, Comscore reports. "To place a number on its possible opening weekend is difficult, since there really is no directly comparable release scenario," Dergarabedian said. "And the biggest opening weekend since the mid-March start of the pandemic shutdown for movie theaters didn't even eclipse the $10 million mark." He's referencing "The Croods: A New Age," an animated film from Dreamworks, which debuted over Thanksgiving. It had the highest opening of any film released during the pandemic, a paltry $9.7 million. For the full five-day Thanksgiving weekend it tallied $14.2 million. Still, there is pent-up demand for "Wonder Woman 1984." This could convince moviegoers to head to the big screen instead of watching the film at home. "We're seeing 'Wonder Woman 1984' drive the strongest ticket pre-sales of any film in the pandemic era thus far, but I'm leaning cautiously toward over $10 million for the weekend given the number of theater closures, audience caution and a simultaneous streaming release," said Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at Boxoffice.com. "A figure closer to $15 million could be achievable but there's a great deal of unpredictability to factor in right now." Robbins said premium screens such as IMAX and Dolby Cinema will likely be some of the top-performing venues for the sequel because they offer higher quality sound and picture. Private party rentals, where moviegoers rent out a theater for a group of as many as 20 friends and family members, will also likely generate a healthy share of the box office. In the last five years, the Christmas Day box office has generated at least $80 million for the single day. That figure will not be seen this year, analysts agree. In non-pandemic times, "Wonder Woman 1984" could have opened at between $100 million and $150 million, Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter said. With so many theaters shuttered, the threat of the coronavirus looming and the availability of the film on HBO Max, Pachter predicted an opening of between $15 million and $25 million. "While many will be choosing to stay home this holiday and watch the film, fans and families in markets where safe and able to do so could turn out in relatively fair numbers, though a far cry from what they would typically be for a blockbuster superhero sequel opening on Christmas," Robbins said.

        Sun, Nov 1 2020 7:00 PM EST Two more days Biden tells Pennsylvania it will decide the future Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden speaks during a drive-in campaign rally at Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR) Park on November 01, 2020 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Drew Angerer | Getty Images News | Getty Images Joe Biden delivered a scathing critique of the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus pandemic during a drive-in rally in Philadelphia, telling his supporters that the future of the country is in the hands of Pennsylvania voters. "Pennsylvania is critical to this election," the former vice president said, as supporters honked their car horns in approval. "The power to change this country, not figuratively, is literally in the hands of Philadelphia and Pennsylvania." Biden laid responsibility for the deaths of more than 230,000 Americans from coronavirus, over 8,800 of which occurred in Pennsylvania, and more than 9 million infections nationwide squarely at the feet of Trump, asking "imagine where we would be if this president just wore a mask instead of mocked it from the beginning?" Biden vowed to put an action plan in place on day one of his presidency to get the surging coronavirus outbreaks across the country under control, through masking, social distancing, testing and tracing. "Two more days, two more days," the former vice president said. "In two days, we put an end to a presidency that has divided this nation," Biden said. "In two days, we put an end to a presidency that has failed to protect this nation. In two days, we can put an end to a presidency that has fanned the flames of hate all across this nation." Spencer Kimball Sun, Nov 1 2020 6:20 PM EST Trump, confident in victory, says 'there's not going to be a transition' President Donald Trump arrives at a campaign rally at Dubuque Regional Airport on November 1, 2020 in Dubuque, Iowa. Mario Tama | Getty Images News | Getty Images President Donald Trump dismissed questions about whether he would accept the election outcome if he loses, telling supporters in Iowa that he's winning despite polls showing Democratic nominee Joe Biden ahead nationally and in several key swing states. "Now they say, will you respect the decision of the voters? And will there be a friendly transition? First of all, there's not going to be a transition, we're winning," Trump told supporters in Dubuque. An Iowa poll published Saturday showed Trump pulling ahead of Biden in the Hawkeye State by seven points. Several polls show Biden leading in other battleground states including Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Arizona. The former vice president leads nationally by 10 points, according to a NBC/WSJ survey. The president's comments come amid a new report that Trump has told confidants he will declare victory Tuesday night if it looks like he's ahead. It could take days for key swing states like Pennsylvania to finish counting mail-in ballots, raising concerns about a tense period of time without a clear winner. Trump has repeatedly declined to state unequivocally that he will accept the election outcome in the event he loses. Spencer Kimball Sun, Nov 1 2020 5:18 PM EST Joe Biden leads in key Rust Belt states, Reuters/Ipsos poll finds Democratic nominee Joe Biden holds a 10-point lead in Wisconsin and Michigan and a 7-point lead in Pennsylvania, according to new polls from Reuters/Ipsos . The percentage of voters who said they planned to vote for Biden was over 50% in each of the three states, which all voted for President Donald Trump in 2016. The online polls were conducted from Oct. 27 to Nov. 1 and had more than 1,000 participants in each state with a margin of error of 4 percentage points. The Upper Midwest and Pennsylvania have seen some of the heaviest campaigning this election cycle after Trump's narrow victories in those states four years ago fueled his surprise election win. Reuters/Ipsos also has Biden slightly ahead in its most recent polls of Arizona, Florida and North Carolina, though the leads were within the margin of error. Those polls were conducted from Oct. 21 to Oct. 27. Jesse Pound Sun, Nov 1 2020 2:31 PM EST White House advisor Scott Atlas apologizes for appearing on RT Dr. Scott Atlas speaks to reporters during a news conference held by U.S. President Donald Trump in the Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House in Washington, September 16, 2020. Leah Millis | Reuters White House health advisor Dr. Scott Atlas apologized on Twitter for appearing on RT, the Russia-controlled television network, where he downplayed concerns about the coronavirus pandemic and criticized "lockdowns." Atlas said that he was "unaware they are a registered foreign agent." The controversy around RT has been ongoing for several years, with U.S. intelligence officials describing the television network as a Russian tool to undermine faith in the U.S. government in a 2017 report . The network registered as a foreign agent later that year. "The rapid expansion of RT's operations and budget and recent candid statements by RT's leadership point to the channel's importance to the Kremlin as a messaging tool and indicate a Kremlin-directed campaign to undermine faith in the US Government and fuel political protest," the report said. Atlas has drawn criticism, including from Dr. Anthony Fauci, for his advice on the United States' pandemic response. Jesse Pound Sun, Nov 1 2020 2:12 PM EST Texas Supreme Court rejects GOP push to invalidate more than 120,000 drive-thru ballots A worker puts a ballot into a lock box at a drive-thru mail ballot hand delivery center in Austin, Texas, U.S., on Friday, Oct. 2, 2020. Sergio Flores | Bloomberg | Getty Images The Texas Supreme Court rejected an effort by Republicans to invalidate more than 120,000 ballots cast at drive-thru polling places in the state's most populous county. The decision marked an incremental win for Democrats and Harris County, Texas, which implemented the voting method in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Republicans are pursuing a similar challenge in federal court, which could ultimately result in the votes being disqualified. "A car is not a polling place. If a car is a polling place, Harris County now has millions of voting locations around the county that change locations throughout the day," the Republicans argued in court papers. Democrats countered that the drive-thru sites "follow identical procedures used at every other early voting location" and had been approved by the Texas Secretary of State over the summer. Trump beat Hillary Clinton in Texas by nine percentage points and is leading Biden in the state by a slimmer margin of about two points, according to recent polls. Tucker Higgins Sun, Nov 1 2020 1:52 PM EST Biden and Harris lay out plans for Pennsylvania barnstorm on Monday Biden and Harris are going all in on Pennsylvania on Monday. The Democrats detailed plans to barnstorm the state the day before the election, with Biden and his wife, Dr. Jill Biden, traveling across the western half of the state while Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, visit the east. "Along the way, they'll visit the collar counties surrounding Philadelphia, will visit Black and Latino neighborhoods in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and the Lehigh Valley, and will meet with farmers and students to get out the vote for the Biden-Harris ticket," the Biden campaign said in a statement. Monday night, Harris is scheduled to host a rally in Philadelphia while Biden addresses supporters in Pittsburgh, where he kicked off his campaign. The Trump and Biden campaigns are zeroing in on Pennsylvania in the race's final days. Trump's campaign sees Pennsylvania as the most critical opportunity of the contest, NBC News reported on Sunday, citing people familiar with the conversations. Biden leads Trump in Pennsylvania by about four percentage points in recent polls. Tucker Higgins Sun, Nov 1 2020 1:20 PM EST Biden to campaign in Ohio on Monday Democratic Presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden delivers remarks at a voter mobilization event in Cincinnati, Ohio, on October 12, 2020, where he will speak to the importance of Ohioans making their voices heard this election. Jim Watson | AFP | Getty Images Democratic nominee Joe Biden will make an appearance in Cleveland, Ohio, on Monday before the final day of voting, his campaign announced. Ohio has traditionally been viewed as a bellwether of the overall election outcome but has trended more toward Republicans in recent cycles. President Donald Trump won the state by more than 8 percentage points in 2016 despite losing the national popular vote. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, said on CNN's "State of the Union" that he expected Trump to win the state, with strong support in the Ohio Valley region and in rural counties. "I think the President's ground game has been a lot better than the Biden ground game, frankly," DeWine said. DeWine's predecessor, two-term Republican Gov. John Kasich, has endorsed Biden and spoke at the Democratic National Convention. Kasich ran unsuccessfully for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. Biden's other recent campaign stops include Pennsylvania, Iowa and Michigan. Jesse Pound Sun, Nov 1 2020 12:53 PM EST Majority of Pennsylvania ballots will be counted in "matter of days," secretary says Pennsylvania Secretary of Commonwealth Kathy Boockvar expects the majority of ballots in the state to be counted "within a matter of days" after Election Day on Nov. 3 Nearly 2.4 two million Pennsylvanians have already cast their votes. There are ten times as many mail-in ballots for the 2020 election compared to the last presidential election in the state, Boockvar said in an interview with NBC News. "Elections have never been called election night," Boockvar said, referring to service members overseas who have until a week after Election Day to cast ballots in some states. "I expect that the overwhelming majority of ballots in Pennsylvania, that's mail-in and absentee ballots, as well as in-person ballots, will be counted within a matter of days," she said. The Trump campaign has tried to block Pennsylvania and other crucial battleground states from extending the deadline for counting absentee ballots, a challenge that was ultimately blocked by the Supreme Court. President Trump has claimed without evidence that "bad things" could happen while states count ballots in the days following the election. Emma Newburger Sun, Nov 1 2020 11:42 AM EST GOP chairwoman predicts Election Day surge: 'Thats why we are going to win' US President Donald Trump speaks during a rally at Pittsburgh-Butler Regional Airport in Butler, Pennsylvania on October 31, 2020. Mandel Ngan | AFP | Getty Images GOP Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said that high Republican turnout on Election Day will be enough to power Trump to victory despite a flood of early votes from Democrats. "Republicans will have a surge that day, we are going to have that, and that's why we are going to win," McDaniel told Margaret Brennan of CBS News on "Face the Nation." "Covid has changed things. So it has pulled a lot of Democrat Election Day voters into that absentee and early vote category and Republicans are wanting to vote on Election Day in person and cast their ballot that way," McDaniel explained. "So we feel very strong that we have a surge coming on Election Day." McDaniel added that Republicans had 2.5 million volunteers and 3,000 staff on the ground around the country. "We are contacting these voters, right now, all weekend, through the next few days, to make sure they turn out to vote," she said. More than 92 million Americans have already cast their ballots, which represents 66.8% of the total voter turnout in the 2016 presidential election.

(Photo By Raymond Boyd/Getty Images) Raymond Boyd | Michael Ochs Archives | Getty Images The editorial board of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, the largest newspaper in western Pennsylvania, endorsed Donald Trump for President on Saturday night , marking the first time since Richard Nixon in 1972 that it has supported a Republican for President. The editorial touted the economic performance of the United States and Pittsburgh region prior to the Covid-19 pandemic as a key reason to support Trump while also being critical of the president's personal character. "We believe Mr. Trump, for all his faults, is the better choice this year. We respect and understand those who feel otherwise. We wish that we could be more enthusiastic and we hope the president can become more dignified and statesmanlike," the editorial said. The management at the paper has increasingly been at odds with its reports in recent years, with the union representing the Post-Gazette's reporters calling for the executive editor to resign earlier this year due to coverage decisions surrounding the George Floyd protests. Jesse Pound Sun, Nov 1 2020 10:50 AM EST Early voting ends in Wisconsin today More than 92 million votes have already been cast for the 2020 election nationwide. Early in-person voting ends in Wisconsin today, according to the Wisconsin Elections Commission Check here for more information on when polling sites close in other states. Emma Newburger Sun, Nov 1 2020 10:36 AM EST Fauci gives dismal assessment of pandemic and White House lashes out (L-R) U.S. President Donald Trump and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci arrive for a briefing on the coronavirus pandemic in the press briefing room of the White House on March 26, 2020 in Washington, DC. Drew Angerer | Getty Images Dr. Anthony Fauci drew a sharp rebuke from the White House after offering a grim assessment of the state of the pandemic in the United States and criticizing the Trump administration's response. "All the stars are aligned in the wrong place as you go into the fall and winter season, with people congregating at home indoors," Fauci told the Washington Post in an interview Friday . "You could not possibly be positioned more poorly." Fauci said the U.S. needed to make an "abrupt change" in public health policies and practice to slow the spread of the virus. He also criticized Dr. Scott Atlas, a neuroradiologist who has criticized economic restrictions to slow the virus and become favored by President Donald Trump, saying "I have real problems with that guy" and that Atlas did not have the expertise to be advising on a pandemic. In response to Fauci's comments, White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement that "It's unacceptable and breaking with all norms for Dr. Fauci, a senior member of the President's Coronavirus Taskforce and someone who has praised President Trump's actions throughout this pandemic, to choose three days before an election to play politics." Jesse Pound Sun, Nov 1 2020 10:05 AM EST Biden leads Trump among Latino voters A supporter of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden shouts as she attends a rally outside the "Latinos for Trump Roundtable" event in Doral, Florida, on September 25, 2020. Marco Bello | AFP | Getty Images Joe Biden leads President Donald Trump among Latino voters by a 2-1 margin just days before Election Day, a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Telemundo survey has found. The poll finds that 62% of Latino voters support Biden, while only 29% support Trump. Among Hispanic women, 71% support Biden while only 19% support Trump. However, Latino voter interest in the election ranks below other groups, with 67% saying their interest in the election ranks a nine or ten out of ten, versus 87% of white voters and 80% of Black voters who have the same level of interest. Emma Newburger Sun, Nov 1 2020 9:57 AM EST Trump campaign confident about Florida, North Carolina despite polls showing tight race U.S. President Donald Trump dances after speaking to supporters during a rally on October 31, 2020 in Montoursville, Pennsylvania. Eduardo Munoz Alvarez | Getty Images News | Getty Images The Trump campaign is projecting confidence about the president's chances of winning the vote in the battleground states of Florida and North Carolina despite state polls showing a tight race. NBC News, citing unnamed people familiar with the campaign's conversations, reported Sunday that some allies of the president believe based on internal polling that the races in those states will be called early on Tuesday evening. They did not provide evidence, though, or the polls themselves. The reelection campaign is reportedly less confident about the states of the upper Midwest, including Michigan and Wisconsin, according to NBC News. Biden is narrowly leading Trump in Florida and North Carolina, according to recent averages of publicly available polls. In Michigan and Wisconsin, the former vice president maintains a lead of more than five percentage points. If Biden wins in Michigan and Wisconsin and Trump wins in Florida and North Carolina, Trump will also likely have to pick up both Ohio and Pennsylvania in order to have a shot at winning in the the Electoral College. Ohio is neck-and-neck based on recent polls and Biden leads in recent surveys of Pennsylvania. According to NBC News, the Trump campaign is completely optimistic about its chances of winning Ohio, but sees Pennsylvania as the most critical state in the whole contest. Trump, who will spend a substantial portion of the race's final days in Pennsylvania, has acknowledged the significance of the state, where Biden maintains his campaign headquarters. "If we win Pennsylvania, it's over," Trumps told thousands of his supporters at an event in the state on Saturday. Tucker Higgins Sun, Nov 1 2020 9:51 AM EST White House advisor Scott Atlas goes on Russia-controlled TV to criticize "lockdowns" White House coronavirus adviser Dr. Scott Atlas speaks during a press conference in the Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House in Washington, DC, September 18, 2020. Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty Images White House health advisor Dr. Scott Atlas appeared on Russia's state-controlled television channel, RT, on Saturday and downplayed concerns about the pandemic. Atlas said that the "lockdowns," which he defined as including the process of testing asymptomatic individuals and isolating positive tests and quarantining possible cases, were "killing people." He also said he was "proud to be an outlier," responding to a comment from Dr. Anthony Fauci. Atlas has become a controversial figure during the pandemic, with former colleagues from Stanford criticizing him in an open letter and Twitter deleting a post of his about masks for being "misleading." NBC News reported in September that Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield said of Atlas that " everything he says is false ." The Kremlin-backed RT is also viewed suspiciously by many amid concerns about foreign election interference. U.S. intelligence officials said in a 2017 report that RT "seeks to influence politics, fuel discontent in US."

Trump takes the lead among white voters (51% to 45%) and whites without degrees (58% to 37%). He also takes a narrow 1-point lead among men (48% to 47%).

Drew Angerer | Getty Images Joe Biden was one of the youngest people to be elected to the Senate and is one of the oldest to run for president.He had just turned 30, the minimum age, when he was sworn in to the upper chamber. Tuesday's election is 2 weeks before his 78th birthday. Biden failed in two pervious bids for the Oval Office, in 1988 and 2008. Then at age 76, he decided to try again, motivated by President Donald Trump's declaration after the deadly neo-Nazi march in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017 that there were " very fine people on both sides ." "We are in the battle for the soul of this nation," Biden declared. Here's a look at Biden's life and long career as the quintessential D.C. insider tries to dislodge the incomparable outsider from the White House. Marty Steinberg Sun, Nov 1 2020 8:03 AM EST Florida is basically a dead heat, but Biden leads in Arizona, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania Former Vice President Joe Biden leads President Donald Trump in four crucial swing states, powered by voters who did not participate in the 2016 election, according to a New York Times/Siena College poll . Biden leads by 6 points in Arizona, 3 points in Florida, 6 points in Pennsylvania and 11 points in Wisconsin. Florida, however, is really a dead heat due to the 3.2 point margin of error. The margin of error is 3.2 points in Wisconsin as well; 3 points in Arizona and 2.4 points in Pennsylvania, according to the Times. In Wisconsin, voters who didn't cast a ballot in 2016 favor Biden by 19 points, the Times reports.

        By Darren Boyle for MailOnline Published: 01:02 GMT, 26 November 2020 | Updated: 14:13 GMT, 26 November 2020  1.3k View comments  A top casting agent has banned British boys from auditioning to play a young Prince William in an upcoming film about his mother Diana because of Brexit. Amy Hubbard is seeking an 11-year-old boy to play Prince William in Spencer, a new biopic made by a German firm about the late Princess, played by Kristen Stewart. In a casting call, Ms Hubbard appealed for boys who could play the role, which is believed to be fairly substantial and will require them for almost three months. However, the agent added that the boy must have a European passport and 'not British European due to new Brexit rules from January 1, 2021'. With just five weeks left until the UK finally leaves the EU, there is still no Brexit deal - so it is unclear what the rules on Britons working in the region will be from next year. And it has led British actors to raise concerns they might lose out on roles due to Brexit amid concerns over freedom of movement ending. Kristen Stewart, will play Princess Diana, left, in a new biopic called Spencer being shot in January by a German movie company Casting agents are looking for a boy aged between nine and 12 to play Prince William - however Brexit rules mean the youngster must have an EU passport Casting agent Amy Hubbard has worked on hit TV shows for the BBC, ITV and Netflix, including the Trial of Christine Keeler, White House Farm, and Isolation Stories In a post, Ms Hubbard wrote: 'Amy Hubbard Casting are looking for a boy with a playing age of 9-12 years to believably play Prince William at 11 years old. 'Must have a European passport. (Not British European due to new Brexit rules from January 1, 2021). Must be available from January 26 to March 30, 2021.' Ms Hubbard has worked on hit TV shows for the BBC, ITV and Netflix, including the Trial of Christine Keeler, White House Farm, and Isolation Stories. The film is set on the Queen's Sandringham Estate in the 1990s when Princess Diana realises over the course of three days that her marriage was over.   A young boy is being sought to play Prince William, who is pictured above as a child in 1992     The biopic is being made by Berlin-based Komplizen Film. What are the rules on Britons working in the EU at the moment? Britons can continue to live, work and study in EU counties before December 31, 2020 without restrictions. This is thanks to the Withdrawal Agreement since February 1, 2020. It sets out a transition period which lasts until December 31 this year, before changes relating to the UK leaving the EU take place. The rules on travelling to the EU also remain the same until the end of 2020. Can British people work in the EU after Brexit? With just five weeks left until the UK finally leaves the EU, there is still no Brexit deal. But the Withdrawal Agreement states British citizens who are lawfully resident in EU member states before January 2021 can still work in the EU thereafter, and will have until June 30 2021 to apply for residence status. Some member states have said also that they will extend the deadline. However, if you travel to an EU country after the transition period, you will not fall under the Withdrawal Agreement. Any rights not covered by the Withdrawal Agreement will be the subject of future negotiations. Several social media users asked why a British boy would not be able to take the role, suggesting it may relate to the decision to strip British citizens of the freedom to live and work across the EU. Ms Hubbard responded: 'It's not about travel. It's common on films that the passport for significant characters needs to match that of the financiers.' She also described the situation as 'depressing'. British actors were left unimpressed by the post, with Clued Up star Tristan Pretty tweeting: 'Sorry to highjack this tweet... But does this mean us British actors might lose out on roles due to Brexit potentially?' Ms Hubbard replied: 'Common on films - wherever finance is from, some of the important roles will need to have same passport / citizenship. It's not to do with visa / travel / admin / red tape.' Thomas Mitchells, who worked as a voice artist on the film Rocketman, added: 'Wow. That line in brackets is depressing isn't it? This is the UK reality now, folks!' And Martin Johnston, who played Albus Dumbledore in the Harry Potter and the Cursed Child play in London, added: 'Freedom of Movement ends for UK Citizens in 37 days. 'This will adversely impact UK talent. Work abroad will require visas/work permits, which are adversely time consuming for quick turnaround work. Casting service providers, please introduce dual passports as a searchable criteria.' Economist Julian Jessop, who is a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, tweeted: 'Not heard this one before! If the financiers do indeed require roles to go to EU citizens, when did that start to bite, given that we have already left the EU? 'What does it mean for all the current stars of the series? Are they exempt because they were signed before we left?' Published by Associated Newspapers Ltd Part of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group

        By Tom Leonard for the Daily Mail Published: 01:28 GMT, 26 November 2020 | Updated: 20:41 GMT, 26 November 2020  111 View comments  Princess Margaret chain-smoked at a back table, Ava Gardner joined the pianist for an impromptu duet and Elizabeth Taylor packed her guest Rock Hudson off to the nearest gay haunt for a 'boys' night'. Richard Harris and Peter O'Toole would drunkenly bellow songs into the early hours, but Sean Connery got shown the door for refusing to order food with his alcohol. That said, the menu was hardly what drew the stars to Joe Allen, the restaurant for London's Theatreland. Sex Pistol Sid Vicious and girlfriend Nancy Spungen touched tongues for this notorious 1977 photo at one of its tables Princess Margaret visited Joe Allen,the restaurant for London's Theatreland. Pictured: Princess Margaret smoking a cigarette whilst visiting Yugoslavia in 1970 For 43 years, the Covent Garden institution has effectively been the staff canteen for the West End, and actors in general, a place where they could expect not to be bothered, and where the staff could be trusted. Sex Pistol Sid Vicious and girlfriend Nancy Spungen touched tongues for a notorious 1977 photo at one of its tables, but they were the exception. The myriad other famous performers from Judi Dench and Ian McKellen to Barbara Windsor and Rod Stewart who have dined at Joe Allen go there not to be noticed. Now, after decades feeding and watering the stars, the latter are showing their affection for Joe's in return. Friends of the restaurant, which has been closed since March due to Covid, have been taking part in a series of online 'virtual cabaret' shows to raise money for both Joe Allen and Acting For Others, an umbrella for 14 theatre charities as they struggle through a crisis that has brought the West End to its knees. Tonight, the last of three virtual cabaret evenings, An Evening At Joe's, will feature Dame Judi, Sir Ian and Jennifer Saunders among the cast.

Jennifer Saunders will feature tonight in the 'virtual' cabaret evenings to raise money A 'virtual' evening at Joe's may prove rather more sedate than the real thing. In the heyday of showbusiness drinking, says general manager Cathy Winn, who has worked at Joe Allen for 30 years, an ambulance would turn up outside most Friday nights as someone or other would have had a heart attack at their table. The biggest celebrity boozers of them all Peter O'Toole and Richard Harris could always be relied on to pitch up late and inebriated. 'They used to drive me mad. At the end of the night, they'd always come in p***-drunk and want to sing badly around the piano until the early hours,' Cathy recalls. But most guests were far more discreet although not always courteous. A keen theatregoer, Princess Margaret once invited Derek Jacobi (himself a Joe Allen regular) to dine with her and some ballet world friends. The biggest celebrity boozers of them all Peter O'Toole and Richard Harris could always be relied on to pitch up late and inebriated. Pictured: Peter O'Toole, who died at the age of 81 in 2013 - just one year after he announced his retirement 'There were eight of us and I sat next to her,' he recalled. 'She smoked continuously, not even putting out her cigarette when the soup arrived, but instead leaning it up against the ashtray. 'We got on terribly well, talking about her mum and her sister, and she really made me feel like I was a friend . . . until she got a cigarette out and I picked up a lighter and she snatched it out of my hand and gave it to a ballet dancer called David Wall.' She told the astonished actor: 'You don't light my cigarette, dear. Oh no, you're not that close.' The restaurant, where Graham Norton was once a waiter, was not only styled on a classic American bar, with show posters lining bare brick walls and red and white checked tablecloths, but an almost exact replica of the original Joe Allen in Manhattan. Allen and his business partner, fellow American Richard Polo, came to Britain 12 years after opening the New York restaurant, finding cheap basement premises in a former orchid warehouse. The restaurant moved to a new home in 2017 after Robert De Niro announced plans (later scrapped) to redevelop the entire block as a boutique hotel. Now, after decades feeding and watering the stars, the latter are showing their affection for Joe's in return. Friends of the restaurant, which has been closed since March due to Covid, have been taking part in a series of online 'virtual cabaret' to raise money. Pictured: The interior of the Joe Allen restaurant Ingrid Bergman, right, known for her role in Casablanca, has visited Joe's restaurant The brasserie had an appropriately showbizzy start when the Broadway cast of A Chorus Line, who were in town, high-kicked all the way down the bar singing A Singular Sensation. In the early days, the British outpost down a side street and identifiable by a small brass plate had a 'speakeasy' feel: to obtain an all-important late licence, the restaurant hired a talented pianist. Jimmy Hardwick played there six nights a week for 37 years. An early Joe's tradition, enthusiastically adopted by Porridge actor and regular Christopher Biggins, was to order the worst thing on the menu a famously disgusting tapioca pudding and have it sent to other diners. General manager Cathy can reel off an endless list of stars who have patronised Joe's through the years, ranging from acting royalty such as Ingrid Bergman, Maggie Smith, Joan Collins, Julie Andrews and Liza Minnelli, through younger British actors such as Damian Lewis, Keira Knightley, Rosamund Pike and on to the casts of EastEnders and Coronation Street. The drugs and drink-plagued singer-songwriter Amy Winehouse was one of the more tragic patrons. 'She did spend a lot of time going to the lavatory,' says Cathy. 'She was a very lovely girl.' While staff would try to protect stars from being bothered by fans Barbara Windsor was particularly vulnerable, says Cathy, because 'people just think they can go and chat to her' only Laurence Olivier and Dustin Hoffman were once accorded the privilege of having a waiter stationed next to their table all evening to ensure they weren't disturbed. Julie Andrews has visited Joe Allen, the restaurant which has seen many famous guests over the years While staff would try to protect stars from being bothered by fans Barbara Windsor (pictured) was particularly vulnerable, says Cathy, because 'people just think they can go and chat to her Needless to say, there has been the occasional difficult customer since 1977. 'It was before my time, but Kenneth Williams used to come in with his mum every Sunday. Apparently, they were very, very difficult very challenging,' she says. 'Nothing was ever right.' The American actress Elaine Stritch was 'outrageously behaved' whenever she popped in, says Cathy. Stritch, an alcoholic who could down a bottle of gin in one sitting, would wait until she had particularly shockable-looking diners nearby before getting out a hypodermic syringe she was a diabetic and injecting herself with insulin at the table, 'cackling away manically'. Kevin Spacey could also be a tricky customer who, Cathy observed, had no time for anyone he didn't consider to be important or useful to him. However, 'the rudest, most horrible man' she ever encountered was no surprise Harvey Weinstein. The now disgraced film producer would come up for lunch from the Savoy, where he stayed when visiting London, in a huge limo. He'd turn up even after being told they were fully booked, march over to sit at an empty table and refuse to budge from it. 'One time he came in with some of his lackeys and all these actors came to his table and left crying. One after the other,' recalls Cathy. Harvey Weinstein (pictured) was 'the rudest, most horrible man'. He'd turn up even after being told they were fully booked, march over to sit at an empty table and refuse to budge from it (file photo) There was usually a fierce pecking order in who sat where, with the tables lining the restaurant's back wall being particularly prized. Pictured: A waiter setting tables at the Joe Allen restaurant There was usually a fierce pecking order in who sat where, with the tables lining the restaurant's back wall being particularly prized. No one wanted to sit anywhere near the theatre critics who ventured in. A quiet, often empty overflow room, dubbed Siberia, was reserved for those not in the know and Barry Manilow, who insisted on dining there as he hated being looked at. Not that actors, a convivial bunch, will stay where they're seated. Cathy says she would have a nightmare trying to track people down for their bills 'as they'd just wander off and join another table and then get utterly sloshed and forget they hadn't paid'. Although actors descended on Joe Allen from 10pm, after their shows had finished, it was also patronised by hardened criminals. Great Train Robber Tommy Wisbey and gangster 'Mad' Frankie Fraser were regulars. Cathy remembers one Christmas the restaurant was packed, and she was about to turn away a new arrival when she saw it was Fraser. 'I was like: 'Oh no, you can have a table. No problem at all. This way please.' ' Just one of the spicier ingredients in the Joe Allen brew. n An Evening At Joe's will take place tonight from 8pm to 9pm via YouTube.

Glover is part of the Crew-1 mission that launched aboard the SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, nicknamed 'Dragon Resilience,' on November 15. This is Glover's first trip to space and in the video shares the excitement 'the video doesn't do it justice,' Glover says wide-eyed and smiling as he looked down at Earth. The short clip, shared on Twitter, is just a few seconds long but shows the curve of our planet, the stunning blue sky and thing clouds spread out in the atmosphere. 'Looking at the Earth through the window of Dragon Resilience,' Glover wrote in the tweet. 'The scale of detail and sensory inputs made this a breathtaking perspective!' Scroll down for videos NASA astronaut Victor Glover shared his first video from space as he and three other astronauts soared above the Earth while traveling to the International Space Station Glover fell in love with space when he was in middle school and decades later is living out that dream 250 miles above Earth's surface. Crew-1 mission docked with the ISS around 11pm ET Monday, November 16 and emerged from the capsule about two hours after completing necessary checks to ensure the capsule and the ISS had an air-tight seal and were greeted by the other residence of the ship. Glover took the 240 mile trip with his commander Michael Hopkins and fellow astronauts Shannon Walker and Soichi Noguchi from the Japanese space agency, JAXA. Along with reaching his personal dream, Glover has also hit a milestone in history for being the first black person to live on the orbiting lab for an extended stay he will call the massive ship home for the next six months. The short clip, shared on Twitter, is just a few seconds long but shows the curve of our planet, the stunning blue sky and thing clouds spread out in the atmosphere NASA has sent more than 300 American astronauts into space, but only 14 of them been black, The New York Times reports. Glover joined NASA's ranks in 2013 and is a commander in the US Navy, but is now the 14th black astronaut to venture into space. 'Flying has been such an important part of my professional life and I love to do it,' Glover said in a NASA video. '6,400 feet, that's the highest up I've ever been above the ground and so to get to a point beyond that, that'll be a little special moment.' It seems Glover is having that special little moment, as he is now 1,161,600 feet above Earth's surface.

Guin S. Bluford Jr. was the first black astronaut in space, and traveled aboard the Challenger space shuttle in 1983. Mae Jamison became the first black woman to take the journey in 1992 - neither were aboard the ISS, as it was not built until 1998. NASA astronaut Jeanette Epps will become the first black woman to board the ISS in 2021. Epps was set to be the first black astronaut to complete an extended stay on a mission in 2018, but was unexpectedly pulled from her June flight, The Washington Post reports. NASA announced Serena Aun-Chancellor, who previously was assigned to Expedition 58/59, has been reassigned to the Expedition 56/57 crew, taking the place of Epps. The American space agency did not provide an explanation to why there was a crew change, but Epp's brother pointed to racism. Guin S.

NASA astronaut Jeanette Epps (right) will become the first black woman to board the ISS in 2021 'My sister Dr. Jeannette Epps has been fighting against oppressive racism and misogynist in NASA and now they are holding her back and allowing a Caucasian Astronaut to take her place!' Henry Epps wrote in a Facebook post in 2018. Although Glover's adventure is a major milestone in history, he said it is 'bittersweet.' Speaking with The Christian Chronicle, he said: 'I've had some amazing colleagues before me that really could have done it, and there are some amazing folks that will go behind me.' 'I wish it would have already been done, but I try not to draw too much attention to it.' Glover is married to Dionna Odom, and they have four children.

        'What was very important for me was that I wanted to play at a club where I could see myself for many years, and Tottenham was just the one', he said. 'I'm very proud, very happy, excited. I think there is a fantastic future ahead for the club, and I wanted so much to be a part of that. 'Spurs has fantastic players, fantastic manager, a fantastic set-up. Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg has slotted in brilliantly since joining Tottenham from Southampton Hojbjerg moved to north London in a 20m deal in August and it's proved an excellent decision 'I feel lucky and proud to be a part of it, and I want to give my everything, but I also want to learn a lot, to push for the next step, but still keeping that consistency.' Those are the words of Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg upon signing for Tottenham Hotspur on August 11. Fast forward three-and-a-half months to today and Spurs' summer signing looks like he's been at the club for years as he continues to take several steps forward. Hojbjerg joined the north London outfit in a 20million transfer from Southampton. Despite being the club's first signing of the summer window, the midfielder's arrival was overshadowed by Tottenham's later acquisitions - none more so than the return of Gareth Bale on loan from Real Madrid. Hojbjerg may have been a signing that didn't create much fanfare among Tottenham supporters, but they already know his worth under their manager Jose Mourinho. The 25-year-old has started all nine of Tottenham's Premier League games this season and it's no coincidence that they sit top of the table on 20 points - level with reigning champions Liverpool but with a plus-seven greater goal difference. The midfielder has started all nine Premier League games for high-flying Spurs this season Playing at the base of Spurs' midfield in a 4-2-3-1 formation, the Denmark international has been brilliant in the double-pivot role this season. Out of Mourinho's central midfield options he has been the standout player. Only Tanguy Ndombele has also featured in all nine games this season, but the Frenchman has been used twice off the bench. In terms of his main skillset it's unsurprising that Hojbjerg leads his team-mates (Ndombele, Moussa Sissoko, Giovani Lo Celso and Harry Winks) in the defensive statistics. Nobody has made more tackles (27) than the Dane or made more recoveries (64). The caveat should be, of course, that he has played more minutes (810) than anyone else. However, the drop off between him and Sissoko is striking considering the latter has played the second most minutes (573). The Frenchman has made 35 recoveries - 29 fewer than Hojbjerg - and made 12 tackles - 17 less in this category. He has made 27 tackles in the league this season - the most out of Spurs' central midfielders TOTTENHAM CENTRAL MIDFIELDER STATS IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE THIS TERM Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg Tanguy Ndombele Moussa Sissoko Giovani Lo Celso Harry Winks Appearances 9 9 7 6 4 Minutes 810 486 573 210 257 Goals 0 1 0 1 0 Assists 1 1 0 0 0 Total Shots 2 4 0 9 0 Chances Created 5 7 2 6 1 Passes 695 281 274 135 210 Passes played into box 8 9 4 15 5 Passing Accuracy (%) 89.06 82.21 89.05 79.26 87.62 Tackles 29 8 12 6 4 Interceptions 7 4 12 1 0 Recoveries 64 23 35 12 15 Fouls Conceded 18 7 10 6 2 Dribbled past by opponent 16 9 4 7 4 Duel Success (%) 48.6 45.31 44 42.86 50 Games Won 6 6 5 5 1 In terms of duel success, Hojbjerg has won 48.6 per cent of his encounters. Only Winks (50 per cent) has a higher percentage but he has featured just four times in the top flight this season and played 257 minutes. Therefore, this can boost his average. In an attacking sense, the Tottenham No 5's game is equally impressive. He and Ndombele are the only two central midfielders to provide an assist (one each) while nobody has made more passes than the former (695). Ndombele is the nearest at 281 passes - highlighting the amount of phases that go through Hojbjerg. In terms of passing accuracy too, the midfielder tops this category with 89.06 per cent pass completion. In fact, in his five seasons in the Premier League (including his spell at Southampton) this is Hojbjerg's best season for this statistic. He's also enjoying career highs in terms of average number of passes (77.2) and tackles (3.2) per game. The above highlights Hojbjerg's influence on Tottenham but it's how his role has modified in England's top flight which is the most eye-catching. The 25-year-old Dane is in possession a lot more now than when he was at Southampton (right) Under Mourinho he has become more of a ball player than when he was at Southampton. His first season at Southampton (2016-17 season) yielded an average of 69.4 passes per 90 minutes and that is the closest figure to his current career high. Again this should be caveated by the fact that Tottenham tend to have more possession in games than Southampton do. But you don't have to just compare Hojbjerg's numbers against his own or his Tottenham team-mates' to note his improvement. Before this weekend's action (November 27-30) no Premier League midfielder has made more passes (695) or completed more (619) than the 25-year-old this season so far. Manchester City's Rodri is second in both statistics (644 passes and 586 completed). In terms of touches, Hojbjerg is the chief manipulator of a ball (806 touches). Leicester City star Youri Tielemans is second in this list but has touched the ball 71 times fewer (738). When comparing defensive efforts only Everton midfielder Allan (35) and ex-Southampton team-mate Oriol Romeu (33) have made more tackles. No Premier League midfielder has had more touches of a ball than Hojbjerg (806) this season Hojbjerg is joint-sixth in terms of recoveries - a list that is headed up Rodri and Leeds' Stuart Dallas (75 each), with Dallas' figures boosted by the fact he can also play in defence for Marcelo Bielsa's side. Relating to clearances and duels won, Hojbjerg is also in the top 10 - emphasising his all-action impact at Spurs. Hojbjerg is Mourinho's midfield general and was excellent in their 2-0 statement win over title rivals Manchester City on November 21. A picture of Mourinho at full-time passionately growling at his midfielder was soon picked up by the club's social media account. Hojbjerg duly quote-tweeted it with the message 'beast mode'. The Dane has certainly been that as the Spurs go marching on. They'll be hoping that form continues on Sunday at bitter rivals Chelsea. After beating Manchester City, Jose Mourinho passionately growled at his midfield general Hojbjerg will be hoping to celebrate at full-time on Sunday when Spurs travel to rivals Chelsea

        Tim Sherwood may have been somewhat over the top when he said Jose Mourinho had 'brainwashed' his Tottenham players into thinking they could win the Premier League title. But after such a solid start to the season, which included a sublime defensive display against Manchester City last week, there is reason to believe Tottenham could well challenge. Chelsea , too, must think they have a chance sitting two places behind Tottenham right now and Frank Lampard will no doubt relish making it three wins on the spin over Mourinho when the two sides meet at Stamford Bridge on Sunday. Familiar faces Jose Mourinho (left) and Frank Lampard (right) will meet once again when Tottenham face Chelsea on Sunday afternoon in a top-of-the-table encounter It promises to be a fascinating battle between two sides who both have been tight at the back while highly efficient in attack. Mourinho v Lampard. The teacher and the student. Here, Sportsmail assesses some of the key battles and where the clash between first and third will be won and lost. Another Jose Mourinho defensive masterclass can Spurs stop Hakim Ziyech as they did Kevin De Bruyne? Last Saturday's meeting with Manchester City in north London was supposed to spell the end of Tottenham's good fortune. It was suggested that City's attacking quality would be enough to break a Spurs side that had only conceded nine goals after eight games. Instead, Pep Guardiola's side were made to look distinctly average as Spurs set up to contain and then counter. Son Heung-min struck early before Giovani Lo Celso added a second. It was a performance built on a strong defensive foundation. City, often so dangerous when playing through Kevin De Bruyne, were stifled much because their chief creative spark was starved of options. City dominated possession 66.1 per cent to 33.9 but that was mainly because Tottenham allowed them to have the ball while they retreated into a defensive shape. Mourinho set his side out to sit deep and nullify any threat made by City star Kevin De Bruyne The Spurs defence will now have to stop an in-form Hakim Ziyech (left) at Stamford Bridge There were times when Son dropped so deep Serge Aurier was almost forced to overlap him while Harry Kane often strayed from his usual position in attack to the left side of midfield where he acted as another body in Tottenham's quest to stop De Bruyne. That they successfully handled such a threat should give Mourinho confidence of a similarly difficult challenge: preventing Hakim Ziyech from causing the sort of havoc he did when Sheffield United visited Stamford Bridge earlier in the month. Ziyech has three assists from five games and is emerging as Chelsea's key creator. While he does occupy a wider position on the pitch than De Bruyne, Mourinho's plan will be to stop the former Ajax midfielder from playing defence-splitting passes to Timo Werner, Christian Pulisic and Tammy Abraham. The return of Pulisic and what it means for Chelsea's cramped attack... He is the player Chelsea fans have been waiting to come back and it looks as though Sunday's derby will be when they get to see Christian Pulisic somehow fit into an already packed-out attack. Lampard said after Chelsea's 2-1 win in midweek over Rennes that Pulisic would be fit in time for the game - that raises questions as to where he fits in. Lampard's suggestion that he has 'competition' in attack is an understatement. Recently he has gone with Werner on the left, Abraham through the middle and Ziyech on the right. Christian Pulisic (right) will return to the team and offer more attacking options for Chelsea It is a combination that offers plenty of variety with Abraham proving his worth centrally with Werner and Ziyech also in outstanding form. While some may expect Pulisic to replace Abraham, which would shift Werner to a more central position, it wouldn't be a surprise if Lampard was to start the American on the bench. In his last four games for Chelsea, Abraham has netted three times. In the 2-0 win over Newcastle he showed how much of an understanding he has developed with Werner in such a short space of time. Abraham kept up with Werner as the German tore through the Newcastle half and got into position to supply a cool finish when the ball eventually reached him. Lampard has gone with Timo Werner (right) on the left and Tammy Abraham in the middle And if it isn't those two combining then Ziyech is never far from unlocking opposition defences, something he did for fun against Sheffield United before the international break. What we can be sure about, though, is that with Pulisic back and Callum Hudson-Odoi along with Kai Havertz and Olivier Giroud to choose from, Lampard isn't short of attacking options. Getting his attacking selection right against Tottenham could be the difference between victory or defeat. Which Chelsea full-back will have the job of stopping Son? Much of Lampard's preparation for this game will have centred on how to stop Son and Kane combining as they have done nine times this season. Indeed, both have combined a staggering 29 times in total for Tottenham in the Premier League since they started playing together in 2015. Both have undoubtedly been spurred on by Mourinho's arrival with the Portuguese manager taking Kane to one side early in his reign to tell the striker just how good he could make him. And while Kane has continued to excel, Son has added another layer to his game that has helped Tottenham reach the heights they have this season. His tally of nine goals is one behind Everton striker and the Premier League's top scorer Dominic Calvert-Lewin. Not only will Lampard need to drill his defence to combat the attacking prowess of both players, he will also need to make his best guess as to which side of the pitch Son will play. Son Heung-min got Spurs off to a lightening quick start against City as he broke the deadlock Chelsea's defenders will have a tough time keeping the South Korean star quiet on Sunday Against Manchester City he was deployed on the right but in the game before against West Brom he was on the left. While Gareth Bale tends to play on the right, which naturally pushes Son to the left, Mourinho can change things up should he want to. Mourinho will also have noted - as some did after the 2-1 win over Rennes - that Ben Chilwell didn't appear as fresh as he has previously. Chilwell also played the full game against Rennes suggesting that Lampard isn't too concerned over the left back's fitness and will most likely start him on Sunday. And although Lampard played Cesar Azpilicueta in the Champions League, Reece James has the pace to keep up with Son at full flight. Indeed, should Lampard go with a three in central defence there may well be space for both Azpilicueta and James. Tottenham's defensive conundrum Against a dynamic attack such as Chelsea's you need intelligence, experience, pace and strength. So losing perhaps your most experienced central defender isn't such a good start. Toby Alderweireld went down in the last 10 minutes of Tottenham's win over City on Saturday with a groin injury, which Mourinho described as 'bad'. On Wednesday, Mourinho confirmed that the Belgium central defender would be out for two to four weeks, ruling him out of Sunday's match. Joe Rodon replaced Alderweireld against City and is in contention to start his first Premier League match against Chelsea. Toby Alderweireld (bottom) went down with a muscle injury in Tottenham's win over Man City Japhet Tanganga is also a possibility and has experience of being thrust into the limelight at short notice - he impressed when called upon in last season's home game against Liverpool. It is a tough call to make particularly when you consider just how solid Eric Dier and Alderweireld have been when playing together - the two centre backs have been at the heart of the defence which has conceded the fewest goals - nine - in the league this season. Mourinho may well turn to Davinson Sanchez, who started alongside Tanganga on Thursday night at home to Ludogorets. Sanchez is the most experienced of the trio and has a major point to prove to Mourinho, who put Rodon on the bench against City in place of him. How can Tottenham break down Chelsea's solid defence? If getting their defence right wasn't enough without Alderweireld, Tottenham must also find a way of breaking down a defensive line that has only shipped two more than them in the league. While Thiago Silva may have raised some eyebrows with his mistake earlier in the season at West Brom, he has settled in and also provides ammunition from set pieces. And even when he hasn't played - such as last weekend against Newcastle - Antonio Rudiger has slotted in smoothly alongside Kurt Zouma. Thiago Silva has settled in quickly while Edouard Mendy has been a wall in Chelsea's goal Then you add goalkeeper Edouard Mendy to the equation and you can see why Lampard has been purring when speaking about his defence this season. Of Mendy, who has kept four clean sheets in five games, Lampard said: 'I've been really pleased. It's not easy and he's made it look easy, which is the difficult thing. 'When you come from another league there are of course differences in the Premier League the physical nature, the speed of the league and I think it is unique in those terms.' And his arrival at Chelsea has largely been made easy for him given he's only had to make seven saves in the league this season due to a tight defence in front of him. Lampard will need to come up with a plan to stop Kane and Son from running riot on Sunday Lampard also has the option of going to three at the back as he did against Tottenham twice last season. On both occasions he out-thought Mourinho to win 2-0 away and 2-1 at home. Mourinho may well have demonstrated a defensive masterclass against Manchester City, but at Chelsea he will need to devise a plan that allows Son and Kane to play with freedom while somehow finding a way past a defence that has been so difficult to penetrate so far this term.

        A worker at a halal abattoir has been sacked and three others suspended after being filmed breaking strict rules on slaughtering sheep. The men could face prosecution for the horrifying yet routine abuse captured by animal rights campaigners using hidden cameras. Slaughtermen at the Bowood Lamb abattoir in Thirsk, North Yorkshire, are seen hacking and sawing at animals throats in apparent contravention of Islamic practice. The RSPCA slammed the 'absolutely shocking' footage amid renewed calls to ban halal slaughter, which is opposed by the British Veterinary Association and 100,000 people in an online petition. Sickening: A worker at a halal abattoir has been sacked and three others suspended after being filmed breaking strict rules on slaughtering sheep Horrifying: The men could face prosecution for the 'routine abuse' captured by animal rights campaigners using secret cameras Sheep at Bowood Lamb were filmed being kicked, lifted and hurled, with one worker recorded standing on a conscious sheeps neck. Staff are also alleged to have erupted in laughter over a sheep bleeding to death with spectacles drawn around her eyes in green paint. Slaughtermen were allegedly filmed taunting and frightening animals by waving knives, smacking them on the head and shouting at them. And instead of praying as the sheep were killed, the Muslim workers chatted as a radio blared out Christmas songs and colleagues sang along. The footage has been released by Animal Aid campaigners and handed to the Food Standards Agency (FSA) to investigate. Slaughtermen at the Bowood Lamb abattoir in Thirsk, North Yorkshire, are allegedly seen hacking and sawing at animals throats in apparent contravention of Islamic practice Instead of praying as the sheep were killed, the Muslim workers chatted as a radio blared out Christmas songs Secretly-placed hidden cameras were used to record practices during slaughter over a period of three days in December. Kate Fowler, head of campaigns at Animal Aid, said: The vicious attacks on defenceless, frightened animals at Bowood are inexcusable. All four conveyor operators we filmed over three days abused animals to varying degrees, while the slaughterers looked on unmoved. She added: This is the 10th slaughterhouse in which we have filmed undercover, and it is the ninth to be caught breaking animal welfare laws. None of the abuses we uncovered would have come to light without our cameras being in place, even though there is a Government-appointed vet at each slaughterhouse. The law requires abattoirs to stun animals before slaughter to prevent unnecessary suffering, but there are exemptions for Jewish and Muslim producers. Slaughtermen were filmed taunting and frightening animals by waving knives, smacking them on the head and shouting at them. Under the halal code, animals are supposed to be killed quickly, with a single sweep of a surgically-sharp knife. They should not see the knife before they are slaughtered, or witness the death of other animals. The video footage appears to show that these rules were routinely flouted at Bowood, where more than 4,000 sheep were filmed being killed. The full dossier by the campaigners said: Sheep were kicked in the face, smashed into solid objects head-first and picked up and hurled by their legs, fleeces, throats and ears A worker stood on the neck of a conscious sheep, then bounced up and down Slaughterhouse workers erupted into laughter at a sheep bleeding to death with spectacles drawn around her eyes in green paint A worker held a sheep by her throat and pulled back a fist as if to punch her Slaughtermen taunted sheep by waving knives, smacking them on the head and shouting at them Slaughtermen hacked away at the throats of still-conscious sheep. Under UK law, slaughtered animals that have not been stunned must remain in position for at least 20 seconds after their throats are cut, to ensure loss of consciousness. But 86 per cent of the sheep at Bowood were moved before that amount of time had elapsed, some in as little as one second, claimed Animal Aid. It said many of the practices defied expectations of what Muslims believe halal slaughter should be. In one horror killing, it appears that the men erupted in laughter as a sheep bled to death with green spectacles painted around its eyes Slaughtermen wearing the traditional Muslim kufi skullcap and muttering the words 'Allahu Akbar' (God is great) were allegedly seen breaking rules in the way sheep were put down. Campaigners said they recognised the risks of stirring up anti-Muslim feeling but witholding release of the footage would be a betrayal of our key mission to expose and combat animal cruelty'. A petition calling for non-stun slaughter to be banned has reached more than 105,000 signatures. Set up by organisations including the British Veterinary Association and RSPCA to improve animal welfare, it will now have to be debated by the Commons Backbench Business Committee after crossing the 100,000 threshold. Last year Prime Minister David Cameron has explicitly ruled out banning non-stun slaughter in a speech to the Israeli parliament. The findings certainly are abhorrent in Islamic practice, and the abattoir must be subject to the full force of the law Muslim Council of Britain Kosher food also requires animals to be conscious when they are killed, although Animal Aid said no kosher meat was prepared in the Bowood Lamb slaughterhouse. Mr Cameron said last year: 'When people challenged Kosher Shechita I have defended it. I fought as a backbench Member of Parliament against the last attempt to do something to change this, and there is no way Im allowing that to change now Im Prime Minister on my watch Shechita is safe in the United Kingdom.' The Muslim Council of Britain said the video was 'abhorrent' and against everything in Islam. 'Animal cruelty is wrong and criminal wherever it may occur,' a spokesman said. That it is being carried out in halal slaughter makes it even more incredulous. 'The findings certainly are abhorrent in Islamic practice, and the abattoir must be subject to the full force of the law. 'There are urgent questions this case raises: since each abattoir is under veterinarian supervision, how were these practices overlooked? We call on the Food Standards Agency to look into this abuse and the flagrant disregard of the very principles of humane slaughter as a matter of urgency.' An RSPCA spokesman said the footage from Bowood Lamb appeared to be 'absolutely shocking'. 'The public has a right to expect that all farmed animals have as painless and humane an end to their lives as possible,' she added. 'The RSPCA firmly believes CCTV in slaughterhouses can be a valuable tool to help improve animal welfare. The law requires abattoirs to stun animals before slaughter to prevent unnecessary suffering, but there are exemptions for Jewish and Muslim producers Campaigners did not want to stir-up anti-Muslim feeling but felt withholding the footage would be a 'betrayal' 'Our concern [about non-stun slaughter] has nothing to do with the expression of religious belief but with the practice of killing by throat cutting without pre-stunning. 'We believe that meat produced from animals stunned or not stunned before slaughter should be clearly labelled to allow consumer choice.' The British Veterinary Association said the film was 'truly shocking' and blamed the government for not introducing EU regulations already used in Wales and Scotland. 'The government has delayed the introduction of the EU regulation Welfare of Animals at the Time of Killing (WATOK) which would require slaughterhouses to appoint an animal welfare officer,' a spokesman said. 'These abuses could have been prevented if a welfare officer had been present protecting the welfare of livestock. 'The BVA has long believed that slaughter without pre-stunning unnecessarily compromise animal welfare at the time of death. It affects millions of animals every year and action is long overdue.' The FSA, which regulates abattoirs, confirmed four slaughtermen have had their licences suspended and an investigation launched. There is no excuse for treating animals in the way shown on the video and we are therefore investigating the footage with a view to prosecution Food Standards Agency A spokesman said: The Food Standards Agency takes animal welfare at abattoirs very seriously which is why we immediately suspended the licences of the slaughtermen involved. There is no excuse for treating animals in the way shown on the video and we are therefore investigating the footage with a view to prosecution. We are also continuing to investigate all the circumstances around the incident to ensure proper safeguards are introduced to stop this happening in the future. The halal market could be worth as much as 2billion a year, with more than 100 million animals killed using the method annually. A statement issued by Bowood Lamb's solicitors said: 'Bowood Lamb makes animal welfare its highest priority. We set very high standards for the way in which animals that pass through our premises are treated. 'It is highly regrettable that one of our slaughtermen fell below those standards. As soon as we were aware of this failing we dismissed this staff member for gross misconduct. 'Currently three other members of staff have had their licences suspended because Animal Aid claims that they have committed technical infringements of the regulations relating to religious slaughter. 'We will await the outcome of any investigation relating to their suspension.' The statement said the real problem was Defra rules relating to animal conveyer belts and attacked Animal Aid for 'breaking into our plant' - a claim the campaigners firmly deny. 'Bowood Lamb is surprised that Animal Aid targeted our premises, given the stated aim of their campaign is to encourage CCTV in abattoirs,' the statement said. 'Bowood Lamb has had CCTV in our premises for over four years. 'We cannot condone Animal Aid breaking into our plant and undermining the strict hygiene controls we have in place.'

        Personalized, Latest & Breaking News  Agriculture is the prime occupation of the taluk. Farmers will be happy only if they get good rains and sufficient fertilisers. Last year, it rained well but the farmers were is deep trouble due to the improper supply of fertilisers.According to the Department of Agriculture, the taluk has paddy fields of over 6,000 hectares. Apart from this, people also depend on banana, ginger, areca, rubber, turmeric and other commercial crops. The point to be noted here is that more fertiliser is being used here for commercial crops than for the paddy.As per the department, over 3,850 tonne fertilisers had been supplied in the taluk last year. A local co-operative society had a turn over of more than one crore rupees. Private agencies had also sold much of the quantity.Demand vs supplyThe Department of Agriculture considers the requirements of only khata land holdings. But in realty, since there is more encroached land in the taluk, the people feel that the estimation of the department would not suffice the necessity. The department does not have any data on the demand from the unauthorised cultivators.The taluk that shares a prominent place in per capita income of the State, has more demand for fertilisers due to the dominance of commercial crops. Ferliser is usually supplied to the co-operative societies through the State Co-operative Federation on the basis of the estimation the local Agriculture Department gives to the Joint Director of the Department. Since the private agencies get fertiliser directly from the companies, they get it quickly, while the co-operative societies should wait for a long time. By that time, the private people reap good profit in their business.Amidst this, there are also allegations that officials involve in illegal sale of fertilisers at various levels. There are suspicions on the sources of fertilisers of the large scale cultivators and estate owners in the Malnad area. Raita Sangha District President Vinayak said the problems could be solved if the department takes prior steps to prepare proper statistics on the requirements and enough vigilance during distribution.However, the eventual point of the farmers is that there is no use by supplying any quantity of fertilisers if it is not supplied in time.

        Personalized, Latest & Breaking News Osama bin Laden's presence in Abbottabad was definitely known to "somebody" in Pakistan, Islamabad's former top diplomat in the US, Husain Haqqani, has said, arguing that his country owes an explanation to the world about the slain al Qaeda leader's local benefactor. Haqqani, who was forced to resign as Ambassador to the US last year over the Memogate scandal, wondered why there has not been any fact finding on the entire episode yet and contended that Pakistan has to nail down responsibility if it has to prove its hands were clean."Even Friday knew where Robinson Crusoe was," Haqqani said in his remarks at the Center for the National Interest, formerly known as the Nixon Center."Somebody knew. I mean, nobody lives anywhere without anybody knowing... Somebody in Pakistan knew. Who that somebody is, it's Pakistan's responsibility to identify," the former Pakistan Ambassador to the US said.Haqqani said he was not suggesting that the Pakistani establishment knew about the Abbottabad hideout of the once elusive al Qaeda leader, but insisted there was support for him from some quarter that needed to be identified."There's no report on bin Laden yet. No one is saying it was the government... but somebody helped him. Somebody bought the place for him, somebody paid for the electricity bills, somebody helped bring food there, and at least that should be identified and it hasn't been," he said."It's Pakistan's responsibility to the world to say who did it. It doesn't have to be the government, it doesn't have to be the military, but whoever it is, we have to come clean on that, because that is the only way we will assure the rest of the world that Pakistan's government and Pakistan's state has its hands clean on this whole thing," Haqqani said. The former Pakistani diplomat said it was just as unrealistic for Pakistanis to think that the US would side with Pakistan by launching a war on India as it was for the US to think Pakistan would give up its nuclear weapons or sever ties with extremists."Equally unrealistic is that Pakistan... will give up support for jihadi groups that it deems to be a sub conventional force multiplier for regional influence," he said.Haqqani said the US and Pakistan would enjoy a healthier relationship if they abandoned mutual "delusions" and thought of each other as something less than allies.Noting that the two countries have always had different goals for their alliance, he said this has led to continual tension.The United States has aimed to engage Pakistan in order to eventually change it into a more stable and friendly state, he said.On the other hand, he argued, Pakistan has aimed to instill its views of the region in America.A looser relationship would allow them to act in areas where their interests diverge without creating feelings of betrayal, he observed.

        Personalized, Latest & Breaking News The decision of Mother Teresa's orphanages not to offer children for adoption over ideological differences with the new adoption guidelines has kicked off a debate whether single parents should be allowed to adopt a child with Women and Child Development Ministry not willing to bend the revised rules.While the provision of adoption by single parent was stipulated in previous guidelines, it was not law-binding. The present rules make it mandatory for every child care institution to offer children for adoption by prospective parents including single men and women.Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity are running 18 orphanages across India for the past more than 50 years, which will soon be de-recognised as far as adoption is concerned."Adoption is a personal thing. We are not against single parenting. Nowadays even single parents can do better look-after of a child. But the rules laid down by the 'Mother' does not make us comfortable with this concept and we do not want to go against it," Sunita Kumari, spokesperson of Missionaries of Charity Sunita Kumar told PTI."We will continue to do our work. We feel fortunate that we were able to send children for adoption for so many years. But now if they (Ministry) want to change we cannot do anything," she said. After exhibiting its inability to help in the process, the children of these orphanages will be offered for adoption through state government's Child Welfare Committee, Kumari said.The Missionaries for Charity, which runs the Mother Teresa orphanages, has written to the government to de-recognise their institutions on the ground that they cannot offer children for adoption to single parent.However, the Ministry officials said the guidelines were revised to make the process simpler and with an intent to find homes for maximum number of children without compromising on their security."The provision for a single man or woman to adopt a child has always existed and the Christian community was unnecessarily raking up the issue now," sources in the ministry said.While total adoptions within the country in 2012-13 was 4,694, it dropped to 3,924 in 2013-14 and was almost same at 3,988 in 2014-15.Adoptions of children by those coming from abroad was 308 in 2012-13, 422 in 2013-14 and 374 in 2014-125.Since April this year, 1,200 children have been adopted, according to official figures.The Ministry has set a target of 50,000 adoptions by December next year. However, on the issue of foster care, the Ministry has discouraged single parents from becoming foster parents."Both the spouses must be Indian citizens. It is felt that at present single parent should not be encouraged for foster care as they are likely to enter matrimony and this may result in problems," according to the Foster Care guidelines released by the Ministry recently.Foster care allows children, in the age group of 6-18 years, who are victims of sexual or physical abuse, violence, abandoned children whose parents are suffering from terminal illnesses or mental disability or in prison, to be put in foster homes that will provide community and family care.There is no upper limit for taking a child under foster care while the lower limit has been fixed at 35 years. "Both the spouses must be willing to foster the same child," the guidelines said.However, children below 6 years of age will be discouraged for placement in foster care as such small children will be preferably provided a permanent family through adoption.

        Personalized, Latest & Breaking News When a group of farmers in Anjaw the country's easternmost district in Arunachal Pradesh, agreed to shift from the "lucrative"poppycultivation to grow the aromatic large cardamom a decade ago, they were not expecting a huge turnaround in their fortunes. But their decision to move away from the harmfulpoppycultivation has paid off. Come February, the farmers willget to see their organically grown large cardamom exported under a brand name of their own, a reward for the gamble they took years ago. Last week, Chiroidor Organic Producers Company Limited, afarmers' company in Anjaw, signed a MoU with Farm Native India Private Limited, which agreed to pay up to Rs 425 per kg to the farmers and take their brand to the international markets as well. "Farmers were initially reluctant mainly because of the price," Chono Tindya, secretary ofChiroidor Organic Producers Company Limited, told DH on Thursday. "Poppycultivation fetched much more money than crops like large cardamom. But things have become better since 2017 when we started becoming organised and got our crops organically certified." The farmers' company at present has 359 farmers as members. They are cultivatinglarge cardamom in nearly500 hectares of the hills since the Arunachal Pradesh government started offering alternative crops topoppygrowers. "Many are still into poppy cultivation. But if our organic crops get more prices in the market, we will be able to convince more and more farmers to give up the harmful poppy cultivation to switch over to commercial cultivation of large cardamom, turmeric and ginger," Tindya said. With China to its north, Anjaw, situated at an altitude of 1296 metres, is one of the remote places in Arunachal Pradesh. Cultivation ofpoppy, a raw material for narcotic drugs like heroin, is said to be rampant in a few districts, including Anjaw. Ayushi Sudan, deputy commissioner, Anjaw, said annual production of large cardamom by the farmers' company touched 200 tonnes since 2018. "This time, we wanted to push for exports so that the farmers can get better prices for their produce. As a result, now they will get Rs 425 per kg instead of Rs 370 to 390 in the local markets at Hayulaing. This is a small effort to increase and sustain farmers incomes," she said. Sudan said more than 1,800 hectares in Anjaw was under large cardamom cultivation, with the district producing about 1,385 metric tonnes every year. Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister Pema Khandu was elated at the development. "The district has come a long way from being an opium producer to becoming one of the largest producers of large cardamom in Arunachal Pradesh," Khandu tweeted after the MoU was signed.

        NEW DELHI: The total disinvestment realisation of the government during 2002 topped Rs 8,660 crore. The cabinet committee on disinvestment (CCD) had cleared transactions worth Rs 6,168 crore during the year. A big chunk of the realisation came in form of special dividends and dividend tax, with VSNL alone contributing around Rs 2,250 crore, according to a disinvestment ministry statement issued here on the ministrys performance during the year. STC and MMTC contributed Rs 40 crore and Rs 60 crore respectively in a special dividend during the year. Incidentally, while most dividend declarations by VSNL were made in 2001, the ministry has accounted for the entire receipts in 02. The year also saw bidders for some hotels the bids of which had been cleared by CCD in 01 pay up during the year. Ajit Kerkar paid up Rs 153 crore for Juhu Beach Centaur, Mumbai, during the year although the bid was approved in 01. Sale money for Ashok hotels in Agra, Bodhgaya, Mamallapuram and Madurai and Hotel Corporations Rajgir property were also received in 02. The proceeds in the fiscal year 02-03 has been just a little more than Rs 3,200 crore. The disinvestment ministry is optimistic of realising atleast Rs 1,442 crore before the end of this fiscal from the Maruti public issue and transfer of Jessop. Jessop sale to Ruia Cotex has already been cleared by the CCD, but the transfer of ownership has not taken place. Among the companies which may see change of hand are Hindustan Organic Chemicals, Engineers India and State Trading Corporation.

        MUMBAI: Foreign universities may soon be able to set up in India but some of their Indian counterparts are looking in the other direction to better equip students for the demands of the global economy. Some top Indian higher education institutes have had foreign annexes for several years but expansion plans aim to offer students a chance to broaden their horizons and give them an edge in the competitive jobs market. Among them is the private university Amity, which is opening two new global business schools for Indian and international students in New York and San Francisco in July, adding to its existing centres in London and Singapore. The university's chancellor, Atul Chauhan, said the move made sense, particularly for India, as foreign investment increases on the back of the country's recent economic growth. "Business is becoming global and (companies) are looking for leaders and managers who have global experience," he told AFP. "It's becoming more and more important to have the exposure in different countries and cultures." That philosophy is shared by Nitish Jain, president of Mumbai's S.P. Jain Center of Management , which is planning to offer business degrees split between its existing campus in Singapore and a new facility to be built in Sydney. "The world, whether we like it or not, is global and it's becoming more global at a faster pace, so education has got to keep up with the times," he said. The moves come not just as part of a wider worldwide trend for "borderless" education but as the government in New Delhi looks to improve education standards to maintain India's economic growth in the years ahead. Nearly one in three Indians is under 14 and ministers say that 800 to 1,000 new universities are needed in the next decade to increase the number of students going into higher education from the current 12 percent to 30 percent. Some foreign universities, many of which already have tie-ups with Indian establishments, including student exchange programmes, have expressed an interest. Studying abroad has been a major part of education for wealthier Indians for years. About 100,000 Indians study at US universities and 60,000 in other countries, according to the Institute of International Education in New York . Chauhan and Jain say those numbers could increase, with tuition fees at Indian-owned universities abroad typically lower than those at bigger name institutions. It could also change India's own approach to education, which has often been criticised for its emphasis on rote-learning of facts for exams but little else. Foreign firms, for example, have said many Indian graduates, although academically well-qualified, often lack essential "soft skills" required for global business, in particular telephone manner or email etiquette. Amity and S.P. Jain said many of these problems can be eliminated just by mixing with students from different countries, backgrounds and cultures and through a more "all-round" education in and out of the classroom. "Education is not purely about academics. It's about your own skills, critical thinking, analysis and debate, advance communication, understanding cultures of the world," he said. "In a foreign country, you're exposed to so much more." There are signs that the importance of extra-curricular activities long an established part of life in Western universities but not widespread in India is catching on. The elite Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay, for example, said cultural and sporting activities are increasing on its campus and could benefit students in the long run, including in their future careers. "I'm sure recruiters look at this," said Jaya Josha from the IIT. "It's part of their personality development and recruiters are not always from India. They come from all over the world." Widening the scope of Indian universities along similar lines to the US or European model should guide the changes in education, said Chauhan, who was born in Germany and studied in London. "In the end, your degree will only help you 20 percent of your life," he added. "Eighty percent is your personality, your confidence and the way you interact with other human beings. That will lead to your success." Read More News on India Institute of International Education S.P. Jain Center of Management Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay Mumbais S.P.

        According to official data, theconviction rate in theft cases of railway properties has witnessed a steep fall in Mumbai Division of Central Railway. MUMBAI: The conviction rate in theft cases of railway properties has witnessed a steep fall in Mumbai Division of Central Railway (CR), according to official data. Figures obtained from the Mumbai division of Railway Protection Force (RPF) of Central Railway reveal that in 2012, total 341 accused were arrested, out of which 179 (52 per cent) were convicted by the court. The conviction ratio dropped in 2013, when 378 accused were arrested and only 141 (37 per cent) were brought to book, the data said. The year 2014 saw further dip in conviction, when 314 offenders were arrested and only 89 (28 per cent) of them were convicted. The current year has seen the steepest fall in the conviction rate, as up to April 2015, 104 accused were arrested but only 9 out of them (8 per cent) were convicted by the court, as per the data. These accused were booked by the RPF for allegedly stealing the equipments and fittings of the local and mail trains, such as fans, handles, cushion, wires, signalling tools, steel sheets, clamps, etc. The parts are stolen from the trains while they are parked in stabling or carshed, a senior RPF officer said. Signalling fittings are preferred by the thieves, while fittings from electrical, mechanical, pathway, workshop, stores and overhead equipments are also stolen and regularly sold as scrap in the market, he said. On the successful detection of the cases, the official said, "Better surveillance and fixing the responsibility on the staff and proper follow-up with investigative officials have always helped us." Asked to comment on the falling rate of conviction, he said, "Now-a-days, thieves have become smart and they have started availing legal options. Prevailing laws, of which they take undue advantage, need to be made more stricter."

Khattar appealed to farmers to directly talk to the Centre regarding their legitimate issues. The central government is always ready for talks, Khattar said in a tweet. I appeal to farmer brothers to directly talk to the Centre for all their legitimate issues, he added. Khattar told farmers that the path of stir cannot be a medium for the resolution of problems and asserted that a solution will emerge from talks. Farmers have been protesting against the Centre's farm laws, fearing that the new laws would lead to the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporates. They have been demanding the repeal of these laws. The Centre has invited several Punjab farmers outfits for another of talks in Delhi on December 3.

        Sri Lanka England MUM KER RAJ MP Brisbane Heat Melbourne Renegades Odisha Tamil Nadu Punjab Railways Jammu & Kashmir Uttar Pradesh Karnataka Tripura Assam Jharkhand Baroda Chhattisgarh Gujarat Himachal Pradesh Maharashtra Uttarakhand Bengal Hyderabad (India) Otago Women Wellington Women Otago Wellington ST SS Leicestershire Nottinghamshire Nottinghamshire progress on higher Powerplay score after securing dramatic tie off last ball Nottinghamshire 139 for 7 (Clarke 35, Griffiths 3-21) tied with Leicestershire 139 for 7 (Swindells 58, Christian 2-24) - Notts won higher Powerplay score Leicestershire let a golden opportunity slip through their grasp - literally as well as figuratively - to allow Nottinghamshire to book their place in a Vitality T20 Blast semi-final against Lancashire. With 17 runs required from the final seven balls, it seemed Leicestershire had held their nerve in a thrilling East Midlands derby. But then Arron Lilley, fielding at midwicket, made a fearsome mess of an apparently simple piece of ground fielding to concede four to Samit Patel when there should have been a single. Worse was to follow. After Patel had struck a six in the final over, two were required from the final ball to send Nottinghamshire through. When Imad Wasim could only mistime the ball to mid-on, it looked as if he would be limited to a single. But Dieter Klein failed to pick up the ball cleanly and allowed it to pass him by. With the scores finishing level, the winner was to be decided by the side who had lost fewer wickets. But when that, too, was equal, the qualifier was the score after the Powerplay overs. It meant Nottinghamshire qualified for Finals Day Perhaps those fielding errors were the result of pressure, perhaps they were the result of the ball having become slippery in the dew but for a Leicestershire side who had fought back from an awful start with the bat and had held their nerve admirably with the ball it was a bitterly disappointing way to let the game slip away. "We got away with that," Dan Christian, the Nottinghamshire captain, admitted to Sky afterwards. It was hard to disagree. False start By managing just 22 runs in the Powerplay, Leicestershire gave themselves a mountain to climb in the rest of the game. Perhaps surprised by a surface that offered impressive bounce and carry, they managed only one run from the first over and none at all from the third. It represented the fourth worst Powerplay performance by a team batting first in the competition this season. It wasn't just the lack of runs, either. Leicestershire also lost two wickets in those first six overs and another from the first ball of the seventh. At 22 for 3, having only managed two boundaries, it looked as if this could be a one-sided encounter. They did stage something of a comeback. Harry Swindells and Colin Ackermann put on 66 in eight overs, including a spell where they hit 46 off four overs, and by taking 97 off the final 10 overs of the innings, they did give themselves a chance. But, bearing in mind the manner in which the result was decided, that slow start came back to haunt them. Hanging in there Leicestershire's bowlers didn't deserve to be on the wrong side of this result. They were immaculate almost throughout. With seven bowlers used and only one of them - the unfortunate Lilley, who went for 14 from his only one - proving expensive, it might be harsh to pick out any of them in a performance that was characterised by its strength as a unit. But Gavin Griffiths, who was on a hat-trick after Ben Duckett lost his leg stump missing a heave across the line and Chris Nash was brilliantly caught after chipping to mid-on, and Will Davis, who came on for the 14th over and nailed his slower-balls nervelessly, were especially impressive among the seamers. Ackerman enjoyed a fine all-round performance, too. After contributing 43 with the bat, he claimed three wickets with his waspish offbreaks including the apparently key ones of Joe Clarke, who looked in sublime touch before mishitting one to long off, and Tom Moores, who looked as if he were taking his side to victory before he lost his off stump to one that gripped just enough to beat his stroke. But non one bowled better than left-arm spinner Callum Parkinson. Despite bowling his first three overs in the Powerplay, the spell only cost 17 runs. He then returned for the 15th over with Nottinghamshire desperate for quick runs and conceded just four more. More than that, though, he produced the ball of the night to account for Alex Hales. Pitching on leg stump, gripping and spinning past Hales' bat, it hit middle stump and suggested that his brother Matt may not be the only international spinner in the family. It really was a lovely piece of bowling. Samit's up This must have been a frustrating season for Patel. Despite having represented England in all three formats of the game, he currently finds himself struggling to maintain a place in Nottinghamshire's top seven and had faced only seven balls (and made a top score of 4 not out) in the competition before this game. But, aged 35 and a veteran of 287 games in this format, he showed his composure and his class here. Yes, he had some fortune with the fielding, for sure. But the six he hit from the fourth ball of the final over - a glorious drive that flew over long-off - must have been partially responsible for ratcheting up the pressure that resulted in Klein's misfield. Even before that final over, there had been three fours and a sense that Patel knew that if he could take the game deep enough, if he could put some pressure back on Leicestershire, he would be giving his team a chance. Ultimately, he held his nerve and they didn't. Giant-scaring With no side having won this tournament as many times as Leicestershire, it probably sounds incongruous to suggest they were on the verge of a giant killing. But the last of their three victories, in 2011, came the last time they reached Finals Day. Only once since, in 2017, had they reached a quarter-final before this. They have a young side with only three internationals including Klein, who has represented Germany twice. Nottinghamshire, meanwhile, had six internationals in their side including two overseas players. It's only a partially unfair joke to suggest their youth system has its base at Leicestershire Grace Road; it's far from unusual for them to utilise their superior spending power to lure the best players away from Leicestershire: Stuart Broad, James Taylor and Harry Gurney among them. But though it is Notts who progress, and although you suspect this result will sting long into the winter, Leicestershire may feel they made their point rather eloquently in this game. They might not have any money, they might not have many big names and they might not have an especially lovely recent record. But with a fine team spirit, with some clever plans put in place by their enterprising coach, Paul Nixon, they showed once again that they are a team to be respected in this format, at least.

Claydon, the veteran Australian who joined the club from Kent last winter, admitted a charge relating to altering the condition of the ball after being pulled up in a Bob Willis Trophy match against Middlesex, in which he took three first-innings wickets. Sussex initially suspended him for six games across formats, releasing a short statement at the start of September ahead of their Bob Willis Trophy fixture against Surrey, before he returned to the side for the final two matches of the Blast group stage. He was left out of the side for the quarter-final on Thursday after initially being named in a 16-man squad - his replacement, Will Beer, batted at No. 8 and was not used with the ball - and the ECB announced after the game that he had been made unavailable for selection. A Cricket Discipline Commission (CDC) panel met on Wednesday to discuss Claydon's sanction. He was charged with a breach of two ECB directives which said that his conduct should be regarded as "unfair and improper" and "prejudicial to the interests of cricket and likely to bring the game into disrepute". The CDC panel took into account the six-game suspension that Sussex had already imposed, and suspended him for a further three matches, including the Blast quarter-final. He will now miss the first two games of the 2021 season. Sussex will also face a CDC hearing panel after being charged in relation to the incident, which could see them docked points for the 2021 season.

        News Azeem Rafiq calls for witness anonymity in Yorkshire racism investigation Ex-player fears that current cricketers will be reluctant to speak out about colleagues George Dobell 01-Oct-2020 Earlier this month, Azeem Rafiq, a former Yorkshire player, spoke about experiencing institutional racism at the club. Yorkshire have appointed a sub-committee to investigate his allegations Getty Images Facebook Twitter Facebook Messenger Pinterest Email Print Azeem Rafiq says that anonymity needs to be granted to witnesses in the investigation into allegations of racism within Yorkshire cricket. Rafiq, who triggered the review after claiming that "institutional racism" at the club had left him on the brink of suicide , believes potential witnesses may be prevented from sharing their experiences by a fear of damaging their on-going hopes for inclusion within the game. He has received numerous responses to his allegations. While some former team-mates have phoned to apologise for their behaviour, others have phoned to apologise for not doing more to stop inappropriate behaviour when they witnessed it. In all cases, Rafiq has requested they share their comments with the investigation panel. But it seems not all are prepared to do so. "There's been an interesting response," Rafiq told ESPNcricinfo. "Some people have been in touch to apologise and others to offer their support. A few have said 'I've experienced the same things, but I don't want to complain as it will jeopardise my future with the club'. "One guy - the one who said 'there's too many of you lot' when I was in the team with Adil Rashid, Ajmal Shahzad and Rana Naved-ul-Hasan - unfollowed me on Twitter. Another, who was outright racist, called the morning after that piece was published and apologised. He said he had no filter. "I respect that. Obviously it shouldn't have happened, but I can respect the fact he had the humility and bravery to pick up the phone and acknowledge his faults. "A current player was similar. He was in tears. He hadn't done anything himself, but he'd seen things go on and had done nothing to stop them. I said 'That's fine, mate, but if you really want to make it better, you've got to tell the investigation team'. I don't know if he will or not. "Several people have been in touch and said 'we've experienced the same things'," he said. "But when I've asked if they will come forward, they've said 'I can't. My shop will suffer; my son will never be picked again for the youth team' or something like that. "So I hope people who give evidence to the investigation team can do so in secret so there are no repercussions for them. That's the only way we'll get to the bottom of these things." Hanif Malik will no longer appear as part of that panel. Malik, an independent director at Yorkshire and former non-executive director at Sport England, had been the subject of complaints from Rafiq, who claimed he had previously outlined his concerns to him but that no action had been taken. It's understood that Malik has also suffered a family bereavement. It is not clear which of these factors, or both, contributed to him no longer appearing on the sub-committee. The precise terms of reference of the investigation are yet to be published. "I'd actually reported my concerns to quite a few people," Rafiq said. "The PCA have been great, but I reported these things to Matthew Wood [the PCA rep], the chief executive [Mark Arthur] and director of cricket [Martyn Moxon] at Yorkshire a couple of years ago. I reported it to Hanif Malik and the National Asian Cricket Council. I reported these things through every channel that was available to me. Not much progress was made until I spoke to the media."

        Sri Lanka England MUM KER RAJ MP Brisbane Heat Melbourne Renegades Odisha Tamil Nadu Punjab Railways Jammu & Kashmir Uttar Pradesh Karnataka Tripura Assam Jharkhand Baroda Chhattisgarh Gujarat Himachal Pradesh Maharashtra Uttarakhand Bengal Hyderabad (India) Otago Women Wellington Women Otago Wellington ST SS Fifty-over cricket must take a back seat in build-up to T20 World Cup, says senior batsman Jos Buttler believes that the more laidback vibe in the IPL bubble, compared to the necessarily frill-free experience of England's bio-secure environment this summer, may be a factor in the explosive form of his England and Rajasthan team-mate, Jofra Archer, who has been one of the stand-out players of the tournament in the early rounds of competition. In three matches to date, Archer has generated pace and hostility with the white ball, alongside his usual sleight of hand, to claim his three wickets at a tight economy-rate of 7.50. But it is with the bat that he has made his most vivid impressions so far, cracking seven sixes from a total of 15 balls, including four in a row in Rajasthan's opening match against Chennai Super Kings. It is a surge of form that contrasts markedly with Archer's returns with the bat in England colours, for whom he has yet to face a single delivery in T20Is or reach double figures in ODIs - a point that Buttler said had not been lost on his England team-mates at the IPL. "A few guys have been saying, 'where's that been?' and Rajasthan have been joking 'why have we had him down at 10 and 11?'" Buttler said. "But we all know how capable Jofra is with the bat. He's an incredibly talented guy all round, so it's fantastic for him. When he bats the way he has done so far in this tournament, and add that to bowling 90-plus miles an hour, that's a pretty good cricketer." Though he was already returning to form with the ball in England's white-ball campaign against Australia last month, Archer has spoken out about his mental struggles during what amounted to 90 days in England's bubbles at the Ageas Bowl and Emirates Old Trafford, in particular during the Test leg of the summer, when he spent a week in self-isolation after breaching the team's bio-secure protocols during the West Indies series. And Buttler sympathised on that front, acknowledging that the combination of the sunny weather, the presence of families, and the more luxurious hotel facilities in Dubai made for a vast improvement on the experience of the English bubble. "In my opinion, it's nicer here because we're away from the ground," Buttler said. "We don't wake up and have a view of the cricket ground, so it's a bit easier to get away from the cricket. That makes it feel a little bit more normal. "I've managed to have my family with me here as well, which is really nice, and the hotel is great. We're being really well looked after. We've got a beach we can use, and a pool at certain times, and a tennis court, so the two bubbles are a little bit different." The relaxed environment, however, does not mean that the pressure has been off during the opening weeks of the IPL. Far from it, said Buttler, who - like Archer - is one of the tournament's most high-profile overseas signings, so knows as well as anyone what is expected of him in this format. "There's a lot of pressure on him to perform because he's one of the stars of the tournament, one of the stars of our team," Buttler said. "There's a monetary pressure as well at the IPL. Everyone knows how much money someone like Jofra has gone for, and the owners who pay that money expect a certain level of performance. "But I think T20 cricket - not just for Jofra but for all of us - is a lot of fun. It's allows you to go and express yourself without much fear of failure. A lot of the time the odds are in your favour in certain situations, and it allows you to play with a lot of freedom. I don't think it's just Jofra, I think it suits a number of players." The excitement of the early weeks of the tournament, including Rahul Tewatia's remarkable mid-match recovery against KXIP at Sharjah and a Kieron Pollard-inspired Super Over between Mumbai and Bangalore, has been achieved without one of the more notable factors of previous IPLs - the crowd. But, Buttler admitted, even though the players were missing the atmosphere, the fact that the games had lost nothing in intensity was a tribute to cricket's ability to adapt to the conditions in which it has to be played. "I've watched a few games on TV and it comes across really well, it's a really good viewer product," Buttler said. "There are maybe 50,000 at a stadium but there's going to be millions and millions of people watching on TV. So one thing that the bubble environments have shown is how much of a TV sport cricket can be in the digital age. "It certainly is different. You just get used to the IPL and the razzmatazz of the crowds, but there's probably just less emotion in the game [at the moment]. You don't lose the intensity but you lose that crowd reaction to an amazing shot or a wicket, or even when the ball goes into the outfield. "But sport has really adapted to show that it's possible to run successful series and tournaments in this environment, which is a feather in the cap of everyone who's involved with cricket really. We all love the live crowds and hopefully they can come back but it's still been a successful product in this environment."

Twenty-one-year-old wristspinner Glenn, who made her international debut last year, picked up a chart-topping seven wickets against West Indies, gaining 12 slots to attain a career-best ninth position. Australia opener Beth Mooney, England left-arm spinner Sophie Ecclestone, and New Zealand captain Sophie Devine, who were all in action in the two series, retained the top spots in the T20I rankings for the batters, bowlers and allrounders respectively. Meanwhile, even though she sat out the entire T20I series, No. 3-ranked Ellyse Perry's position remained unchanged on the allrounders' list. Australia batting allrounder Ashleigh Gardner advanced seven places to a career best-equalling 18th position among batters thanks to a series-topping 90 runs, 19 more than Lanning, that also saw her claim the Player of the Series award. Legspinner Georgia Wareham, who took five wickets against New Zealand in three T20Is, moved five spots up to reach a career best-equalling 10th position while left-arm spinner Sophie Molineux (up two places to 13th) and seam bowler Delissa Kimmince (up eight places to 22nd) also made notable gains. Amelia Kerr, the 19-year-old legspinning allrounder whose all-round contribution helped New Zealand snare a final-over win in the third and final T20I on Wednesday, retained the fourth position among bowlers, and is the only New Zealander in the top ten of the bowling charts. Meanwhile, Natalie Sciver remains the only England batter in the top 10 and is second on the allrounders' list. Amy Satterthwaite's return to international cricket post-childbirth helped her re-enter the rankings in the 35th position after finishing as New Zealand's leading run-scorer with a 69-run tally. Deandra Dottin rose five places to 15th position after scoring most runs from the West Indian side: 185 runs, including two fifties. According to the latest rankings update, Germany batters Christina Gough (up 146 places to 69th) and Janet Ronalds (up 115 places to joint-82nd) have also advanced, after their side defeated Austria 5-0 in a record-breaking T20I series, which also marked the resumption of women's international cricket since the Covid-19 pandemic took hold worldwide.

The new aircraft carrier is scheduled to come online when the country's flagship warship, the Charles De Gaulle, will be retired in 2038. Macron said that the new vessel will be nuclear-powered like its predecessor because "our strategic future, our status as a great power, lies with the nuclear industry." He said the decision ensured that the country retains its "technical, technological and industrial" nuclear know-how over the long-term and emphasised that nuclear energy is "decarbonised". Armed Forces Minister Florence Parly also stressed that nuclear propulsion means the carrier does not need to be refuelled which allows for "excellent" availability. The new vessel will measure 300 metres 40 metres more than the Charles de Gaulle and transport 30 jet fighters and 2,000 sailors. Weighing 75,000 tonnes, it will travel at a top speed of 50 km/h. Only about a dozen countries worldwide have aircraft carriers. France and the US which has the largest fleet are the only two to have nuclear-powered carriers. The government has not revealed how much its new warship will cost although French media estimate the final price tag at around 7 billion.

The National Anti-Terrorist Prosecutor's Office argued that Hayat Boumeddiene, who is being tried in absentia, had played "an important role" in the preparation of the attacks carried out at the office of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, the Hyper Cacher supermarket, and the murder of a policewoman in Montrouge. The attacks, which took place from January 7-9, 2015, left 17 victims dead - including some of the magazine's most prominent journalists - as well as the three attackers. France 2015 terror attacks: Who are the suspects going on trial? Charlie Hebdo trial resumes amid controversy over video conferencing Prosecutors asked that she serve at least two-thirds of her sentence. "She has never denied the merits of her husband's action" and "has become an instrument of propaganda" for the Islamic State terror group, prosecutors argued. The indictments come after 14 defendants, including fugitive Boumeddiene, went on trial at the Paris Special Assize Court on September 2 accused of helping the perpetrators of the attacks. Boumeddiene - the only woman being tried for the attacks - is wanted by French police after fleeing to Islamic State-held Syria in the days before the attacks. She was captured on CCTV surveillance footage at Madrid airport on January 2, 2015, before she boarded a flight to Istanbul. The subject of an international arrest warrant, her case is still active after a Jihadi returned to France said she met her in a Syrian camp for IS fighters in October 2019. During the trial, Boumeddiene's sisters testified that she calls them at least once a year to catch up. The other defendants stand accused of helping plan the logistics of the attacks, including procuring weapons and tactical gear for attackers Coulibaly and brothers Sad and Chrif Kouachi. The prosecution demanded a life sentence for Ali Riza Polat for his "pivotal" role in the planning of the attacks. The Franco-Turk citizen, who is believed to have been a close friend of Coulibaly, is suspected of helping build the weapons the attackers used. Samuel Paty murder: French opinion divided over government response to Islamic terrorism Four more students charged over murder of French teacher Samuel Paty The rest of the defendants are facing sentences from between five years to life in prison if found guilty. The two-month-long trial, which was suspended for three weeks after several defendants tested positive for coronavirus, has gripped France. During the court's sitting, the country also witnessed three more terror attacks on French soil. On September 25, a knife attack in Paris near the former premises of the magazine left two people injured. On October 16, teacher Samuel Paty was beheaded in the capital close to the suburban school he taught at by an Islamic extremist over a lesson on free speech. He "died simply because he passed on to his pupils what freedom of thought and freedom of expression represented," said the president of the court, Rgis de Jorna, during the trial. Three more people were stabbed to death on October 29 in what President Emmanuel Macron described as an "Islamist terrorist attack" at the Notre Dame basilica in Nice.

        View Election misinformation isn't an American phenomenon - it's spreading across Europe, too View Comments last updated: 08/12/2020 By Chine Labbe Share this article Share Tweet Share send Share Tweet Share send Share Send Share Share Share Send Share Share Opinions expressed in View articles are solely those of the authors. Text size Aa Aa The certification of election results was never a big story in the US, let alone in Europe - until this year. With accusations of massive voter fraud alive and well, the accompanying legal process is now presented by many as the ultimate test of American democracy. Almost a month after election day in the United States, misinformation about voting continues to flourish online - in the US of course, but in Europe, too. And just as it threatens the essence of American democracy, it is also threatening to sow distrust in the electoral process in Europe ahead of crucial elections. NewsGuard, a company that rates the credibility of news and information sites, has counted more than 40 French, Italian and German-language websites that published false claims about the 2020 U.S. election. "We all knew that the US Democrats were planning to manipulate the elections But what has happened in the last few days goes beyond what even those who feared electoral fraud expected, in scale and audacity," wrote a German blog on November 5. How US election misinformation has led to real-world tensions | #TheCube What misinformation is there on social media about US voter fraud? On November 26, a French far-right website explained why "the ongoing coup" in the US was "threatening the world". The coup that the site was referring to was not the unsubstantiated claims by President Trump and his supporters to overturn a legitimate election but to the election itself. In Germany and France, Russian outlets RT and Sputnik, known for publishing false information to disparage Russias rivals, joined in on the conspiracies. Even local and detailed instances of alleged fraud, rooted in the intricacies of the American electoral system, found a home on popular misinformation sites in Europe. From "Sharpiegate" in Arizona to allegations of dead people voting in Nevada, European readers were exposed to hyperlocal misinformation narratives powering the overarching idea of massive fraud. False claims have also been shared on countless European social media accounts. With federal elections in Germany and regional elections in France coming up in 2021, and French presidential elections just 18 months away, European leaders have reasons to worry. In the spring of 2020, US-centric QAnon conspiracies - which claim that US President Donald Trump is on a secret mission to rid the world of a cabal of elites who control a Deep State that hides a sprawling network of "pedocriminals" - spread to Europe , where they slowly morphed and adapted to local narratives, thus attracting more followers. In the same way, US-born election hoaxes could well start targeting European electoral processes and adapt to their own nuances and complexities. Misinformation websites are not the only spreaders of US election misinformation. Some European politicians have also backed narratives about widespread voter fraud. Chine Labbe Managing Editor (Europe), NewsGuard At least one hoax seems likely to follow that pattern: the idea that mail-in voting significantly increases incidences of voter fraud. In Germany, mail-in voting is fairly common and has even increased in recent years. And in France, where it was abolished in 1975 - precisely because of fraud, notably in Corsica - some politicians are calling for its reintroduction to help boost voting levels, which have been brought down by the pandemic. "Cant the behaviour of these (American) cheaters who stirred up a coup be compared to that of the French left?" the far-right French website Riposte Laque has already posited. "Yes, the French electoral system is more sophisticated than the American one: mail-in voting has been forbidden since 1975 But there are many other, legal, ways to stuff ballot boxes and influence an election". QAnon sites have proven prime spreaders of baseless claims on the US elections, and despite crackdowns on Q content on Facebook and Twitter, the popularity of QAnon European websites has skyrocketed in recent months. For example, QActus.fr, a French-language site ranked 1,300 in terms of online engagement in France in late July, is now ranked 293, according to data from NewsWhip, a social media analytics company. Facebook vows to tackle vaccine misinformation on its platform Meet the scientists fighting misinformation and educating people about COVID vaccines Misinformation websites are not the only spreaders of US election misinformation. Some European politicians have also backed narratives about widespread voter fraud. In Italy, Guglielmo Picchi, a member of parliament for the right-wing party The League, wrote on Facebook that Democrats were trying to steal the election. In Germany, Beatrix von Storch, deputy party leader of the far-right, anti-immigrant party Alternative for Germany (AfD), tweeted on November 7 : "Who has won the #USElection2020 is far from certain. And that is a good thing: it is up to a democratic constitutional state to eliminate massive evidence of election fraud". By the time election day came in the US, claims of a rigged process had circulated for months. The fact that Americans had been exposed to them for so long allowed new allegations to go viral quickly. Research has shown that "even a single exposure (to false claims) increases subsequent perceptions of accuracy". Thats why European leaders should be concerned that hoaxes related to the very heart of our democracies are being allowed to circulate unchecked for so long before their citizens head to the polls. Months of uncertainty and anxiety around the pandemic have eroded the already weak trust in the mainstream media in Europe, and many popular misinformation websites intend to further promote the idea that large media outlets are hiding the truth. Now is the time to help readers understand which sources they can trust, and which ones have a long history of peddling hoaxes before they stop trusting democracy altogether.

        View The EU must leverage closer trade ties with Uzbekistan to ensure progress on human rights View Comments last updated: 09/12/2020 By Umida Niyazova Share this article Share Tweet Share send Share Tweet Share send Share Send Share Share Share Send Share Share Opinions expressed in View articles are solely those of the authors. Text size Aa Aa Since coming to power four years ago, Uzbekistans president, Shavkat Mirziyoyev has been eager to improve relations with the EU. Under the long-serving authoritarian former president Islam Karimov, Uzbekistan was an international pariah - criticised for its atrocious rights record and kept out of international bodies. Through savvy public relations campaigns and some nominal changes, Mirziyoyev has been at pains to shift that perception. If he succeeds, his prize will come in the next couple of months in the form of specialised European trade preferences that could bring in millions of euros. In June, Uzbekistan applied to become a beneficiary of the EUs Generalised System of Preferences (GSP+) scheme . Through this scheme, the EU grants preferential trade status to a select few countries to encourage sustainable development and good governance. Uzbekistan's rise as the transport and logistics hub of Central Asia EU agrees its own 'Magnitsky' regime to sanction human rights abuses As a developing country, Uzbekistan has long received trade benefits under the standard GSP - but ascension to the GSP+ would double the number of goods that would receive lower tariffs. Trading with the worlds biggest market without tariffs would bring immense economic and financial benefits to Uzbekistans business and economic sectors. In exchange, Uzbekistan would need to ratify and effectively implement 15 core international human and labour rights conventions, as well as 12 international conventions related to the environment and governance principles. Effective implementation is the key phrase here. While Uzbekistan has technically ratified all 27 of these conventions, the conventions have not been implemented effectively at all. The countrys record on human and labour rights and freedoms of the press are still extremely concerning and will demand particular scrutiny before the EU can consider allowing Uzbekistan to join. For over 10 years, Uzbek Forum for Human Rights (the organisation I founded and direct) has documented issues of forced labour, corruption, and other human rights abuses across the country, as well as monitor the overall status of civil society. We have reported on a number of serious issues the EU must consider as part of their review. As Brussels considers whether to allow Tashkent into its elite club of developing states deserving of extraordinary trade preferences, it must not compromise on the values and principles behind admission. Umida Niyazova Founder and director, Uzbek Forum for Human Rights A crushed Uzbek civil society still faces complicated, costly, and bureaucratic procedures to formally register NGOs, which would allow them to attract funding and operate with legitimacy. Human rights organisations, such as Chiroq , have been denied registration time and again on spurious grounds. Only one independent human rights organisation has been registered since President Mirziyoyev came to power in 2016, the second since 2013. In the absence of an empowered civil society to hold power to account, all the greater is the role of the media to report and give voice to issues of concern to the people of Uzbekistan. Under President Mirziyoyev, the media landscape has enjoyed a relaxation of extreme censorship and independent online bloggers and media outlets have gained some freedoms to criticise those in high office. However, on November 23, the Agency for Information and Mass Communications (AIMC) issued a warning to news site Kun.uz that it risked "serious legal consequences" for reporting on chronic gas and electricity shortages that are leaving people freezing in their homes during a pandemic, prompting some criticism from the diplomatic community in Tashkent. This is not the first time that AIMC has issued warnings to the press. In 2019, AIMC issued 150 submissions and warnings which could be grounds for shutting down a media outlet altogether. Freedom Houses Index of Internet Freedom of 2020 ranks Uzbekistan 27 out of 100 - a characterisation of "not free". Uzbekistans stateless: UN hails landmark move allowing 50,000 to apply for citizenship EU will lose supremacy unless it invests more, diplomacy chief tells Euronews In Uzbekistans notoriously brutal agriculture sector , reforms that were supposed to modernise the sector are falling far short. These reforms were supported through millions of dollars of credit from international institutions, such as the International Finance Corporation and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, yet were still documenting human rights violations. This year, for example, there were reports of heads of districts insulting and beating farmers who didnt fulfill the state quotas for soya beans, cotton, or wheat. Farmers are highly vulnerable to extortion by officials due to their dependence on the authorities for their land lease agreements. In August this year, farmers were forced to contribute to a special fund to support the victims of the Sardoba dam collapse by donating their cattle. At present, the annual cotton harvest is coming to a close, a massive undertaking that involves about 1.5 million people. Under President Karimov, the slave-like conditions endured by those picking the "white gold" were well-known. But while most pickers now work voluntarily, Uzbek Forum has documented the forced mobilisation of employees from public sector organisations and the extortion of employees to pay for replacement pickers. As Brussels considers whether to allow Tashkent into its elite club of developing states deserving of extraordinary trade preferences, it must not compromise on the values and principles behind admission. While Uzbekistan has progressed from the dark days under President Karimov, it still has a long way to go. As negotiations move forward, the EU must use all available tools at its disposal to ensure that authorities are kept accountable and deliver on commitments made to ensure human and labour rights. The leverage exists now; but once Uzbekistan is granted GSP+, that will slip away.

        Poland Budapest and Warsaw protest their governments' budget veto by lighting monuments EU-blue Comments By Euronews last updated: 10/12/2020 The Palace of Culture in Warsaw illuminated in blue on December 9, 2020. - Copyright Credit: City of Warsaw, um.warszawa.pl Share this article Share Tweet Share send Share Tweet Share send Share Send Share Share Share Send Share Share Text size Aa Aa Monuments in Warsaw and Budapest will be lighted blue on Wednesday evening to protest the Polish and Hungarian government' decision to veto the European Union's budget over a rule of law conditionality. "The Polish and Hungarian capitals, Budapest and Warsaw, have one voice," the mayor of the Hungarian capital, Karacsony Gergely, wrote on Facebook . "We say no to veto, but we say yes to European values." A lengyel s a magyar fvrosnak, Budapestnek s Varsnak egy a hangja: mi Eurpban maradunk, nem hagyjuk magunkat... Posted by Karcsony Gergely on Wednesday, December 9, 2020 Budapest's Statue of Liberty and Warsaw's Palace of Culture and Science are to be lighted EU-blue for three days starting on Wednesday. Several other Polish cities are also taking part in the event. "This is how we want to emphasise how much we feel part of the European Union," Warsaw mayor, Rafal Trzaskowski, wrote on Facebook . "We hope that our symbolic protest will lead the government to change their position and to overturn its veto (...) We don't agree that in the name of intra-partisan games, in the name of some ridiculous bidding of right-wing politicians, about who is more anti-EU, the welfare of millions of Poles is on the line," he added. Unlike the governments, which are ruled by conservative parties the Law and Justice (PiS) party in Poland and Fidesz in Hungary the capital cities are helmed by liberal opposition politicians. A 1.8 trillion veto The protest is to start hours after Polish President Andrzej Duda announced that a preliminary agreement over the EU budget has been struck with Germany potentially putting an end to a three-week-long deadlock but providing no detail as to what it entails. EU leaders were expected to approve the bloc's next seven-year-budget in mid-November. The 1.8 trillion package also include a 750 billion recovery fund to kickstart economies deeply impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. 'Preliminary agreement' reached over 1.8 trillion EU budget veto, says Poland But Poland and Hungary vetoed the package because of a rule of law conditionality which would see EU funds cut for member states deemed to be backsliding on core European values including press freedom and the independence of the judiciary. Both Poland and Hungary have been criticised by Brussels for reforms weakening the judiciary and media independence, or for their treatment of migrants. Article 7 proceedings the EU's disciplinary clause have been launched against them. The two countries have branded the new rule of law mechanism as "political blackmail" and part of an unfair ideological battle being waged by Brussels. Poles and Hungarians disagree But even in their respective countries, their fight against Brussels is unpopular. A survey for the EU Parliament carried out by pollster Kantar between late September and mid-October found that more than three out of four respondents agree that EU funds should be made conditional upon the national government's implementation of the rule of law and of Democratic values. In both Poland and Hungary, 72 per cent of respondents affirmed so. aHang Hungary and Poland's Akcja Demokracja, two civil movement groups, have also collected some 300,000 messages of support for the rule of law conditionality. EU leaders struggle to break budget deadlock amid veto from Poland and Hungary "It's been unconditional EU funding that kept (Hungarian prime Minister Viktor) Orban and (Polish Prime Minister Mateusz) Morawecki alive and now it's time the EU comes out in support fo the Polish and Hungarian citizens who have been fighting so hard," Piotr Cykowski, Akcja Demokracja's spokesperson, said in a statement. "If EU leaders succumb now, then this will only boost Orban and Morawecki's position against the rule of law and pave the way for more autocratic leaders who will want to weaken Europe," he added.

        News UK Boris Johnson forced into free school meals U-turn after Marcus Rashford campaign as footballer says: Look what we can do together 'THIS is England in 2020' By Joe Murphy @JoeMurphyLondon Sophia Sleigh @SophiaSleigh 16 June 2020 B oris Johnson made a hasty U-turn over free school meals today after a passionate campaign led by footballer Marcus Rashford sparked a Tory rebellion. The Prime Ministers office announced that a brand new Covid Summer Food Fund will be launched to pay for lunches for all 1.3 million children on free meals in term for the whole of the summer holidays. Each family is expected to get a one-off voucher that can be spent in supermarkets each week to buy meals or ingredients. Credit for the embarrassing change of policy, just hours after ministers were out defending the previous refusal to extend the free meals scheme into summer, was given to the Manchester United forward who rallied opinion with a powerful open letter and a barrage of social media appeals . Moments after the decision was announced, he tweeted: "I don't even know what to say. Just look at what we can do when we come together, THIS is England in 2020. A string of Conservatives including Theresa Mays former policy adviser, the chair of the Education Select Committee and the former Scottish Tory leader, had pleaded with the PM to change his mind or risk being defeated. No 10 said it would spend an extra 120 million on the vouchers, expected to be worth around 15 a week. They will go to the families of the 15 per cent of children who are eligible for free meals. The cost is in addition to a 63million scheme announced last week by Mr Johnson to target help only at the most needy cases. The Prime Minister welcomes Marcus Rashfords contribution to the debate around poverty, said the PMs spokesman. He said the PM fully understands the problems faced by families in the unprecedented crisis posed by coronavirus. ( Rashford wrote an open letter to the Government / AFP via Getty Images ) To reflect this we will be providing a Covid Summer Food Fund. Full details will be set out shortly. This is a specific measure to reflect the unique circumstances of the pandemic. The scheme will not continue beyond the summer. The U-turn was announced shortly before an Oposition motion was due to be debated and put to a vote in the Commons. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer tweeted: This is another welcome u-turn from Boris Johnson. The thought of 1.3 million children going hungry this summer was unimaginable. Well done to @MarcusRashford and many others who spoke out so powerfully about this issue. London Mayor Sadiq Khan added: Sensational. @MarcusRashford you have changed the lives of hundreds of thousands of children. A true national hero. Thank you. Piers Morgan, of ITVs Good Morning Britain, tweeted: A magnificent victory for @MarcusRashford. Former England footballer Gary Lineker wrote: Great to see (Manchester Uniteds) number 10 changing policy at number 10. Extraordinary campaign and win for the brilliant @MarcusRashford. It came after Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey was left looking foolish after she challenged Mr Rashfords claim that some families had had their water cut off, yet remained silent on other claims, including that children were going hungry. Ruth Davidson, the former Conservative leader in Scotland, summed up the aghast mood among Tories as she tweeted: Am baffled why [Westminster] colleagues picking this hill to die on. ... Food security during the holidays so important. Its basic. Feed the kids. A modest rebellion of Conservative MPs was expected to increase the embarrassment to the Prime Minister this afternoon. MPs were voting on a Labour motion to repeat a free meals voucher scheme that ran for the Easter holidays right through the summer break. Mr Rashford galvanised opinion revealing he used food banks and depended on free meals as a child. The player has raised 20million to boost food distribution with the charity FareShare. The Prime Minister last week announced 63 million of funding to local authorities to help the most vulnerable families, but turned down calls for free meal vouchers to be carried on for the summer. Yesterday his spokesman rejected Mr Rashfords plea while saying the PM understands the issues facing families. ( Work and pensions secretary Therese Coffey / PA ) But Conservative backbenchers challenged No 10s line today. Former minister George Freeman, who was Theresa Mays policy adviser, shared an open letter sent to MPs by Mr Rashfords letter and commented: This is an unprecedented crisis. The PM and Chancellor Rishi Sunak have been right to take unprecedented steps to help shield the most vulnerable, he said. Free School Meals are a lifeline for many very low income families. Lets do the right thing: extend Free School Meals through summer. Education Committee chair Robert Halfon hailed Mr Rashford as an inspiration and a hero of our time. He told BBC Breakfast he was worried that Britain is facing an ice age for vulnerable children as the latest figures show 2.5 million children are not learning while away from school and food insecurity has nearly doubled. Extending the free school meals programme would be the right thing to do, said the Conservative MP, though he admitted there are mixed views among fellow Tories. In a letter to Minister for Children Vicky Ford he demanded what had been done by the Government to assess levels of need over the summer and a guarantee that funds would be available to all and not just those on benefits so that their children can be properly fed over the summer, including the position of those families with no recourse to public funds. Meanwhile, Mr Rashford got tens of thousands of retweets for a series of comments about the impact of coronavirus on poor families. ( The PM's spokesman gave credit to the footballer / via REUTERS ) When you wake up this morning and run your shower, take a second to think about parents who have had their water turned off during lockdown, the tweeted. When you turn on your kettle to make a cup of tea or coffee think of those parents who have had to default on electricity bill payments just to make ends meet having lost their jobs during the pandemic #maketheuturn And when you head to the fridge to grab the milk, stop and recognise that parents of at least 200,000 children across the country this morning are waking up to empty shelving. That inspired Ms Coffey to make a flat-footed intervention, replying: Water cannot be disconnected though. Her comment was branded out of touch tweet of the year by former Labour cabinet minister Andrew Adonis and snarky by shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds. The footballer himself replied by pointing out the Cabinet minister had only dismissed one of his three comments. Im concerned this is the only tweet of mine you acknowledged, he said. Please, put rivalries aside for a second, and make a difference. With hours to go before this afternoons Commons vote, the footballer issued a rallying cry. We are trending no 1 and 2 in England. I need everyones help to keep this noise going as I head to training but before I go, to ALL MPs in Parliament, this is not about politics. The same way us players put rivalry aside when we put the England shirt on, please #maketheuturn Labour MP Matthew Pennycook, who also received free schoolmeals, added: Marcus Rashfords powerful intervention should not be necessary but I hope it forces the Government to listen. Shadow education secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey described Manchester United footballer Marcus Rashford as one of the best of us. She told BBC Breakfast: As this crisis has brought out the best in many of us I think its only right for the Government to fund free school meals to look after those children so that theyre not hungry, and can spend their time over the summer building up their academic base so that theyre in a position to start learning properly in September. Loading.... She asked ministers to just continue the free school meal voucher programme and pointing to Scotland and Wales, adding: They are going to do this over the Acting leader of the Lib Dems Sir Ed Davey said: Marcus Rashford highlighting with honesty and lived experience why the Government must reverse their decision on providing free school meal vouchers during the summer. He also shows how far we have to travel to end the injustice and unfairness of child poverty.

        News Politics David Cameron warns UK will 'lose respect overseas' with merger of Foreign Office and Department of International Development The former Prime Minister tweeted his commentson Tuesday afternoon followingthe Government's announcement David Cameron has slammed plans to merge the Department for International Development with the Foreign Office / Getty Images By Naomi Ackerman @nomiackerman 16 June 2020 D avid Cameron has warned that merging the Department for International Development (DfID) with the Foreign Office will cause the UK to lose respect on the world stage. The former Conservative leader said that Boris Johnson's decision to merge the two departments was a "mistake", in a pointed public rebuke of his former political rival. "More could and should be done to co-ordinate aid and foreign policy, including through the National Security Council, but the end of DFID-UK will mean less expertise, less voice for development at the top table and ultimately less respect for the UK overseas," he tweeted. Mr Johnson announced the move on Tuesday to MPs, saying: Distinctions between diplomacy and overseas development are artificial and outdated. The new combined department, which will be known as the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office when it launches in September, will be led by Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab. Mr Johnson has signalled that funding for the new department may be directed in areas of strategic geopolitical interest for Britain, such as Ukraine. But the Government has said it will maintain a statutory commitment to spending 0.7 per cent of gross national income on overseas aid. In his rare intervention into current political debates since leaving office, Mr Cameron - a long-term public supporter of DfID - added that he believes that the Prime Minister was was "right to maintain the commitment to 0.7 - it saves lives, promotes a safer world and builds British influence". He was joined in his criticism of the merger by fellow former premiere Tony Blair, who criticised the move as wrong and regressive. In a statement, Mr Blair said: I am utterly dismayed by the decision to abolish Dfid. We created Dfid in 1997 to play a strong, important role in projecting British soft power. It has done so to general global acclaim. It is a leader in both programmes and thought in development, helping millions of the worlds most vulnerable to be relieved of poverty and killer diseases. The strategic aims of alignment with diplomacy and focus on new areas of strategic interest to Britain could be accomplished without its abolition. Wrong and regressive move. Also among those condemning the decision were former international development secretaries from the Prime Minister's own party. Justine Greening attacked the move being made while the fight against Covid-19 is ongoing, saying: People will find it hard to see why its a priority to have a departmental organisation. ( Tony Blair has weighed into the debate / PA ) Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the announcement is a distraction from how poorly the Government is handling the pandemic. Sir Keir said: We should see this statement for what it is, the tactics of pure distraction. He added: A few hours ago the ONS figures showed a fall of 600,000 people on the payroll. The economy contracted by 20% in April and we could be on a verge of the return to mass unemployment, something weve not seen for a generation. Weve also one of the highest death rolls from Covid-19 in the world, at least 41,700 deaths and likely to be far greater than that. And in the last hour the Government has u-turned on free school meals. Loading.... Mr Starmer said: This statement is intended to deflect attention from all of that and can I assure the Prime Minister it will not work.

        News UK Calls for advice behind Christmas bubbles to be published as scientists warn easing restrictions could prompt third wave Experts warned easing measures was throwing fuel on the Covid fire Scientists have warned easing restrictions could lead to a resurgence of coronavirus infections / AP By April Roach @aprilroach28 26 November 2020 S cientists have warned easing coronavirus restrictions over Christmas could lead to a third wave of the pandemic and ultimately result in another lockdown . Boris Johnson urged the public to think carefully over the festive period after it was confirmed that three households will be able to mix from December 23 to 27 . But experts warn the easing of restrictions could lead to more people being admitted to hospital and the reintroduction of lockdown measures in the new year. Earlier this week, Health Secretary Matt Hancock defended the decision not to publish Cabinet papers on economic assessment of measures. He said, Cabinet papers are not typically published to protect decision-making and added that he would discuss this with the Chancellor. Heres all we know about what the experts have said on easing restrictions over the holiday period. What measures will be eased over Christmas? The UK Government and devolved administrations have agreed a joint plan to relax social distancing rules over the festive period, allowing friends and family to hug for the first time in months. Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford has said the decision to agree a relaxing of restrictions over Christmas was to avoid a free for all. Mr Johnson acknowledged the measures would not add up to a normal Christmas and urged people to exercise caution, particularly when meeting with the elderly or the vulnerable. Christmas is not going to be normal, says Chancellor We cant afford to throw caution to the wind. The virus doesnt know its Christmas and we must all be careful, he said in a video message posted on Twitter. I know this doesnt equate to a normal Christmas and it wont work for everyone. And it is up to each of us to think carefully about how we use this time-limited special dispensation. The virus has not gone away and families will need to make a personal judgment about the risk of forming a bubble with or visiting elderly relatives and the vulnerable. A joint statement issued by the four UK governments said they had been working closely together to find a way for family and friends to see each other, recognising it must be limited and cautious. Each Christmas bubble can meet at home, at a place of worship or an outdoor public location, but existing, more restrictive rules on hospitality and other venues will be maintained throughout the period. The bubbles will have to be exclusive over the five-day period, meaning people cannot shift from one group to another although children whose parents are separated will be allowed to move between them. People aged over 65 in care homes will not be able to join their loved ones for Christmas, and in families where three children live away from home, they would not all be able to return for the festive period. What have scientists said about the Christmas bubbles? Professor Graham Medley, an expert in infectious disease modelling at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said the relaxation of coronavirus restrictions at Christmas could lead to more people being admitted to hospital and further lockdown measures in the new year. The Sage attendee told BBC Radio 4s Today programme: I think were in a process now whereby the populations risk of filling up the NHS is really being passed down to us as individuals. For other diseases like flu or hepatitis B, the Government doesnt get involved in helping or determining what our risk is and it is really, I think, for this Christmas up to us as individuals and families to think about what our risks are and how we are going to mitigate them. ( A woman wearing a face mask walks past Christmas trees and decorations in Burlington Arcade, London / AP ) I think it is inevitable that if a lot of people do take that risk, even if it is a small risk, then we will end up with a lot of people in hospital and potentially having to take measures in January to lock down again. Andrew Hayward, professor of infectious diseases epidemiology at University College London, and a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), warned easing measures would lead to increased transmission and a possible third wave of infection. Effectively what this will be doing is throwing fuel on the Covid fire, the professor, who is also a Sage member, told BBC2s Newsnight on Tuesday. He added: With the vaccine on the way, if we are not very careful over Christmas we are really in danger of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory on this one. Public react to Christmas coronavirus rules What measures can people take to try to avoid spreading the virus at Christmas? Prof Medley advised people to isolate before visiting relatives, to consider the amount of time they plan to spend with them, to remain completely faithful to any social bubble arrangements and to weigh up the risk of spreading Covid to those who are vulnerable. But he said, even with mitigations in place, social interactions come with risks that could play out very badly for some people. Scientists have recommended spending more time outdoors or in ventilated spaces to reduce the risk of spreading the virus. Professor Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, told MPs on Tuesday it was risky for people to meet indoors particularly when there are elderly relatives around and alcohol could be involved. Get outside we know outside is so much safer than inside, go for a walk, have a meal outside, she told a joint meeting of the Science and Technology Committee and the Health and Social Care Committee. If youre going to be inside, ventilate, open your windows, make sure theres plenty of air circulation. Stephen Reicher, professor of social psychology at the University of St Andrews said that the virus spreads in enclosed spaces that are crowded and stuffy and called for funds to be allocated for outdoor community events.

        News UK BBC defends Have I Got News For You over joke about bombing Glastonbury to get rid of Jeremy Corbyn supporters Have I Got News For You / PA By Lizzie Edmonds @lizzieedmo 26 November 2020 T he BBC has defended an episode of Have I Got News For You after it featured a joke about bombing Glastonbury to get rid of Jeremy Corbyn supporters. Comedian Fin Taylor said on the BBC One panel show that his relationship with Corbyn is like Bob Dylan , in that I only hate him so much because of his fans, who he called fanatics. And he added: So all youve got to do is, next year, bomb Glastonbury, hopefully Dylans headlining. Two birds, one stone. On Twitter a disgruntled viewer wrote: Usually let the Corbyn bashing slide but this weeks #HIGNFY was too far. First time Ive ever been offended enough to actually report. The BBC said in a statement: After more than 30 years on air, Have I Got News For You is a well-established comedy series that has built a reputation for irreverent humour and satire. Regular viewers expect the panellists to make jokes and understand that contributions are intended to be funny and amusing, and this edition was no exception. It was clear that comedian Fin Taylor was talking about an utterly absurd scenario, in which he compared Jeremy Corbyn to Bob Dylan, and was in no way whatsoever to be taken seriously. ( Jeremy Corbyn / PA ) The BBC previously ruled that a joke by Jo Brand, on BBC Radio 4 programme Heresy and about throwing battery acid at politicians, went beyond what was appropriate for a Radio 4 comedy show. The comedian, 62, sparked outrage when she made comments in 2019 about milkshakes being thrown at politicians, suggesting battery acid could be used instead. She told the Heresy show: Im thinking why bother with a milkshake when you could get some battery acid. Ofcom said the comments, which aired in June 2019, had clear potential to offend listeners. It said the comments were unlikely to encourage or incite the commission of a crime. It cited audience expectations of Brand and the satirical programme, and the comic making it clear her comments should not be taken seriously or acted on. She had said on-air: Im not going to do it, its pure fantasy, but I think milkshakes are pathetic, I really do. The programme was recorded amid political debate about Brexit and around three weeks after Nigel Farage had a milkshake thrown over him by a member of the public.

        The Reveller Restaurants Londons restaurants in Tier 2 will face no specific limit on table sizes for single households dining indoors, No 10 confirms Getty Images By David Ellis @dvh_ellis 26 November 2020 D owning Street has confirmed that while under Tier 2 restrictions, restaurants will be free to serve tables of any size provided diners are all from one household or social bubble. Asked by the Standard to clarify the Tier 2 restrictions, a spokesperson for Number 10 said: "Under tier two, you can visit hospitality venues inside only with your household or support bubble, and you need to order a substantial meal. [There is] no specific limit on numbers." While as the spokesperson makes clear household mixing indoors is explicitly banned under the new Tier 2 rules , the news means large households or support bubbles may all dine out together, and bookings will not be bound to groups of six or fewer. Bizarrely, however, those dining outdoors will have to abide by the rule of six. Restaurants are not required by law to ask for proof that groups are all from one household. The news comes as it appears business lunches in restaurants will once again technically be permitted. A Government spokesperson confirmed to the Standard that the likes of self-employed workers and freelancers, who may not have a workplace to conduct business, would be able to do so in a hospitality setting. Other rules announced by Matt Hancock this morning include a revised curfew now 11pm, with last orders at 10pm and a measure to prevent pubs and bars opening, unless they operate as restaurants. The full Tier 2 restrictions relevant to eating and drinking out can be read here .

        French fishermen TURN on Emmanuel Macron after Brexit ultimatum - 'We've overstepped mark' FRENCH fishermen have lashed out at Emmanuel Macron, warning he is playing a "dangerous game" and has "overstepped the mark" by threatening to veto a post-Brexit trade deal with the UK. Brexit: Deas says nothing has been agreed on fishing Thierry Pouch, chief economist of the French Chambers of Agriculture, said French farmers and fishermen are now "deeply concerned" over the French President's recent efforts to push the EU towards a no-deal outcome over issues around fishing and a "level playing field" on trade rules. He warned the ultimatum provided by Mr Macron, mooted by France's Europe minister Clment Beaune, could have a devastating impact on hard-fought EU unity at such a critical moment for the bloc. Trending Mr Pouch told The Daily Telegraph: Each country reacts in its own interests as always but I get the impression that France has overstepped the mark by threatening a possible veto because that goes against the strategy of showing a united front among the 27 towards London. "So Macron is playing a risky game. Frances intransigence echoes the behaviour of other EU member states on other issues - Im referring to Poland and Hungary on the economic recovery plan." A new EU civil war has broken out after Hungary and Poland have blocked Brussels upcoming 1.6nillion budget over seven years and the huge coronavirus recovery package, which contains clauses linking funding to respect for the Rule of Law. Brexit news: Emmanuel Macron is coming under pressure from French fishermen (Image: PA) Brexit news: The French President has threatened to veto any trade deal with the UK (Image: GETTY) Mr Pouch explained: France is doing likewise on Brexit. I think it is very dangerous for the EU to have so many states that are not pulling in the same direction. France has strongly denied it is acting in its own interests with renewed threats to veto a Brexit trade deal if its demands on fishing rights and the level playing field are not adhered to. Mr Beaune has admitted while it would be "naive to deny" there were different concerns within EU member states, the mandate from chief negotiator Michel Barnier is detailed and "we are sticking with it". Brexit news: Boris Johnson has stood firm against demands from the EU (Image: GETTY) He added: "The main players have all realigned behind the same position. There is unity on the message and on the strategy. France's Europe minister also insisted German Chancellor Angela Merkel "also defends our demands". Mr Beaune said: She knows the European market well enough to guess how the German economy would suffer from a bad agreement. The UKs gamble on a split in the EU has failed. The row over a possible veto of a Brexit trade deal with the UK comes as negotiations continue to stuck at a stalemate around fishing rights, rules for fair trade and an enforcement mechanism. Brexit news: Michel Barnier was in London for trade talks last week (Image: GETTY) Brexit news: The ultimatum provided by Mr Macron, mooted by France's Europe minister Clment Beaune (Image: GETTY) Mr Pouch questioned whether it was right France was demanding the UK closely align itself with EU rules and environmental and social standards in order to export to the bloc, warning this fixation is a mistake. He said: I find it hard to understand why France is so fixated on competition rules. Can we accept that the UK lowers social norms to export? Paris refuses the idea but Im not sure it is worth getting so fixated about as we have sufficient strengths to win market share in the UK and get over this. "So I think its a mistake. Barnier is trying to referee this but is having an incredibly hard time. Mr Pouch also warned the devastating impact a no-deal Brexit could inflict on France. Brexit news: EU countries most reliant on UK fishing waters (Image: EXPRESS) He said: If we lose some of our 2bn trade surplus to the UK on food products, it will be hard to conquer new EU markets as they will be flooded. "That is what happened when we slapped an embargo on Russia in 2014. The chief economist of the French Chambers of Agriculture warned three regions in France are particularly worried about the effects a no-deal outcome with the UK would have on exports alcoholic beverages, dairy products, fruit and vegetables and biscuits and bakery. The Hauts-de-France region in the north of the country is worried about a loss of export on cereals animal feed and grain; the Grand Est region in northeastern France is extremely concerned about losing market share on bakery products; while the Bordeaux region is very worried about wine. The French Chambers of Agriculture believes customs tariffs on European and French dairy products being exported to the UK could surge by as much as 40 percent, with Mr Pouch also warning: These could reach 80-100 per cent on some products, such as cheese." He also issued a stern warning to the UK, warning the British could be hit by a "double whammy" in the event of a no deal that would see prices skyrocket because of new customs tariffs on products and lower purchasing power due to the value of the pound falling against the euro. But he also warned: In that case, British consumers could turn away from European products, principally French, and buy elsewhere. "Its not by chance that the UK recently signed a deal with Japan and Canada. Its in all our interests to avoid damaging trade relations, for the EU, Macron and the British. Without a deal, the UK with its 30 billion trade deficit in food and agriculture products, could be heading for food shortages in the short-term. "But avoiding a no deal is in our interests too.

        BBC Weather: Fog and snow to sweep Europe as continent rocked by 'blocking' high pressure BBC Weather has forecast stagnant and cold air across Europe that will bring mist, fog and frost to the continent over the coming days. BBC Weather forecast cold air and snow across Europe BBC Weather meteorologist Stav Danaos forecast unsettled weather across the Mediterranean for the rest of the week. He added a blocking area of high pressure across Russia was contributing to the unsettling weather. Trending Mr Danaos said: "It is staying very unsettled across parts of the Mediterranean for the rest of this week. "This is because we have areas of low pressure that have been moving in off the Atlantic. "It is because of this blocking area of high pressure which has dominated across much of Russia and into the east and northeast of Europe. "The air is stagnant and cold, we are seeing areas of mist, fog and some overnight frost. Stav Danaos is a BBC Weather Europe meteorologist (Image: BBC) The average temperature across Britain throughout the year (Image: Express) "This big area of low pressure is bringing strong winds, heavy rain, thunderstorms, more snow over the Alps. "This will be spreading its way eastwards across Greece, we will be seeing rains and thunderstorms here." He added: "Another area of low pressure will be sinking southeastwards affecting much of southern France, Spain and Portugal. "It will stay pretty cold across this northwest corner, we will start to see temperatures creeping up as the Atlantic start to push some milder air across the British Isles." UK weather: Met Office warns of 'dense freezing fog' On Tuesday morning, BBC meteorologist Carol Kirkwood stated that rain will continue to push southwards through Tuesday evening and into Wednesday morning. She said: "Through this evening and overnight, our rain continues to push southwards and eastwards. "There'll be showers following in behind in some western areas and, through the night as the cloud sinks southwards, temperatures will actually rise. "We could see some of reform across parts of the southeast but that will be swept away as the rain moves south. Snow in the United Kingdom (Image: Express) "Tomorrow this rain will push away eventually into the North Sea, there will be showers coming in behind it." The Met Office issued severe weather warnings for fog and rain on Tuesday. The Met Office stated that snow in Britain normally occurs later in the winter.

When asked why some of the Scottish fishing fleet was tied up, rather than out fishing, Mr Johnson told the Commons Liaison Committee: "I understand very much the frustrations of... the fishing community and fishermen and women who are facing what I believe are temporary frustrations. In so far as there are delays caused by a variety of problems, we will compensate those fishing businesses.

The Scottish Seafood Association said they welcome the pledge of compensation from the Prime Minister. SSA chief executive Jimmy Buchan said: "We welcome Boris Johnson's unequivocal promise of compensation for fisheries businesses affected by the nightmarish bureaucratic hurdles that have been erected since 1st January.

Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was askedin the Scottish Parliament what measures were being taken to alleviate the situation. She replied: "The catastrophe that our seafood exporters are facing right now is absolutely shameful and disgraceful." But Downing Street has hit back, with a spokeswoman responding: "We are working closely with the industry to help understand and address the issues they are experiencing, including contacting exporters, their representatives and transporters to advise on the requirements for keeping their goods moving. "The Scottish Government cannot abdicate their responsibilities to Scottish businesses. Over the past 18 months they have assured the fishing industry that the systems they were putting in place would be adequate. They clearly are not. "The Scottish Government need to step up and ensure there are no delays to food exports being checked at hubs in their area. "We have given the Scottish Government nearly 200 million to prepare for leaving the EU, to minimise disruption and guarantee business readiness."

The Prime Minister has said there are "teething problems" regarding trade between Britain and Northern Ireland in the wake of exiting the Brexit transition period. However, he told the Commons Liaison Committee that things were running "smoothly". Labour former minister Hilary Benn questioned Mr Johnson on whether he would extend the three-month grace period for Export Health Certificates for trade between Britain and Northern Ireland. In the Liaison Committee, Mr Benn asked: "Can you guarantee that the in supermarkets in both Ireland and Northern Ireland that the grace period will be extended after the end of March?" Mr Johnson replied: "What I can certainly guarantee is if there are serious problems in supplying supermarkets in Northern Ireland because of some piece of bureaucracy that's misapplied then we will simply exercise Article 16 of the protocol. "It's absurd that there should be such difficulties. "We will make sure that supplies continue. "It goes without saying that any difficulties that remain will naturally fall away anyway because the people of Northern Ireland have to vote to retain the protocol in four years time." 6.40pm update: EU Brexit row ERUPTS: Brussels under pressure as regions demand big role in future talks A new Brexit row has broken out after local politicians throughout Europe warned they now want a bigger role in establishing the future relationship between the European Union and the UK following Brexit last month. This was the overwhelming feeling expressed by members of the Committee of the Regions (CoR) at the most recent meeting of the CoR-UK contact group. Log Chesnais-Girard, president of the local parliament of Brittany in France, whose coastline is separated from the United Kingdom by only 300 kilometres, had previously warned cooperation between the UK and EU, both at a regional and local level, must continue after Brexit. He had said: The current stalemate between the European Union and the United Kingdom should not close the door to cooperation at the regional and local level, because regardless of the outcome of the negotiations, local and regional institutions will have to work together even after 2020." This issue was again a key talking point during a meeting on Monday, where the group discussed the importance of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement and for the first time, the significance of it on local politics. But the trade deal quickly came under attack from members, with Oldrich Vlasak, former President of the EU Parliament expressing his disappointment in the treaty. Antje Grotheer, deputy president of Bremens parliament in Germany, also said: The agreement lacks any regional dimension."

Mrs Foster acknowledged a significant challenge around how hauliers transport mixed loads from the rest of the UK, stopping at multiple locations to pick up goods. But red tape has led to empty shelves in some supermarkets in Northern Ireland as retailers attempt to come to terms with the new rules.

Joshua Curiel had previously been involved in pro-EU campaigns and called for a second referendum on the UK's membership with the bloc. But sharing a link to a column he has written for The Daily Telegraph, now-former Remainer Mr Curiel tweeted: "Never thought that I'd be saying something positive about Brexit in the @Telegraph, but I am.

"And exporters are benefiting from the unfettered access between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. "Yes, I am not going to deny down that there are teething problems, and there are issues that we need to sort out... but the deal has been of great, great assistance to our businesses in smoothing this." 4.11pm update: Oh dear, Leo! Varadkars triumphalist Brexit tone came back to haunt him, says expert Leo Varadkars triumphalist tone when it came to Brexit, coupled with belligerent rhetoric which came out of Dublin after the 2016 referendum, torpedoed any hopes of keeping the UK closely aligned with Brussels - and damaged Irelands interests as a result, a former diplomat has said. Mr Varadkar was Taoiseach for much of the time that former UK Prime Minister Theresa May was in office. And during that time, he did her very few favours, said Ray Bassett, Irelands former ambassador to Canada, Jamaica and the Bahamas. Mr Bassett made his remarks during a webinar organised by Yale University entitled Peacebuilding in the Wake of Brexit. Brexit latest: Leo Varadkar has come under attack from a former diplomat (Image: GETTY) 3.17pm update: Watch out Ursula! London finance boss lets fly at EU ahead of crunch Brexit showdown The world should not "underestimate" the might of the City of London in Brexit Britain, the woman responsible for looking after the district's businesses has said. Catherine McGuinness is chair of policy at the City of London Corporation, the local authority for the finance district. She has predicted the City's finance industry will continue to thrive in the years ahead. She said: Weve got to take our destiny into our own hands, weve got to look at the best way forward to the future and what Id say to the rest of the world is dont underestimate the UK. Ms McGuinness's comments come as Brussels looks to try and use Brexit to force more firms to relocate from Britain to the continent. The EU is yet to grant so-called "equivalence" - the process of admitting a country's rules and regulations are similar to the Brussels' own - to UK financial firms. The trade bloc is expected to only grant equivalence in a limited number of areas which benefit the EU in the hope of driving more firms abroad. 3pm update: Sturgeon rages post-Brexit delays to seafood exports are 'shameful and disgraceful' Companies in Scotland trying to to export fish and other seafood from the country have been hit by red tape ince the new trading rules with the EU came into force. Lorries have been delayed at distribution hubs and exporters have struggled to get goods to market in France, leading industry body Scotland Food and Drink to warn "emergency financial aid" may be needed. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was askedin the Scottish Parliament what measures were being taken to alleviate the situation. She replied: "The catastrophe that our seafood exporters are facing right now is absolutely shameful and disgraceful. "But for the crisis of Covid that we're living through right now I am sure this would be dominating the headlines every single day. "The Scottish Government and Scottish food and drink stakeholders have repeatedly warned that businesses need more time to effectively prepare for these changes but the UK Government point blank refused to listen to a request for a six-month grace period. "We're pressing the UK Government to fix this mess, it's a mess entirely of their making. "So far there's no sense of urgency or any suggestion at all that they are prepared to do that." Brexit latest: Nicola Sturgeon launched a scathing attack against the UK Government (Image: GETTY) Paul Withers taking over live reporting fromBill McLoughlin. 2.26pm update: UK ready to invoke Article 16 of the Brexit deal Speaking in response to a question from DUP MP, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, Mr Johnson stated the UK will not hesitate in utilising the mechanism. The Prime Minister said: "I can tell him that at the moment goods are flowing effectively and in normal volumes between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. So far no lorries have been turned back. "Yes of course there are teething problems and what I can confirm to him is that if there are problems that we believe are disproportionate then we will have no hesitation in invoking Article 16." Article 16 of the treaty allows for one side to take unilateral action to enforce safeguards if there has been any negative effect incurred from the treaty. 1.44pm update: UK heading for post-Brexit revival as deal with Australia to inject millions into economy The UK is close to striking a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Australia, which will inject several millions into the economies of both countries, boosting numerous sectors, Australian Senator Eric Abetz has told Express.co.uk. Britain and Australia formally launched trade negotiations this summer, aiming to conclude a comprehensive and ambitious FTA covering goods, services and investment. International Trade Secretary Liz Truss and her Australian counterpart Simon Birmingham kicked off the talks via videoconference on June 17. Australian Liberal Party Senator Eric Abetz has shed light on the numerous opportunities the trade deal will bring in the near future, during an exclusive interview with Express.co.uk. In particular, the Senator singled out the sectors he believes will flourish. He said: "In principle, the more free trade there is, the cheaper commodities for the people in both countries will be. There will be greater opportunities for employment as well. "And look, our agriculture production will be cheaper than the one in Britain, which means the UK will benefit from cheaper food." Brexit news: Boris is ready to continue talks over a deal with Australia (Image: PA) 12.54pm update: US trade deal: Boris prepares to tick key political box to unlock agreement with Biden Boris Johnson will add new provisions to his upcoming negotiations with the US in order to persuade Joe Biden into securing a vital post-Brexit trade deal with UK. In a bid to shift Mr Biden into agreeing a post-Brexit trade deal, Mr Johnson has instructed his team to add climate change guarantees to negotiations. By doing this, it is hoped the team may entice Mr Biden, who has made a series of green pledges into agreeing a deal, with International Trade Secretary, Liz Truss previously declaring her intent to sign a deal by June. It is thought Mr Johnsons team may now add certain pledges such as enhanced air pollution protections and corporate transparency on climate change to bring Mr Biden team to the table. Sources involved in talks have stated further environmental and climate change commitments will tick boxes to spur an agreement on a trade deal. With the UK hosting the United Nations Climate Change Conference this year, the Prime Minister has emphasised the countrys green credentials. An International Trade Department official told City AM: Its no secret that we need to tick key political boxes to get a deal over the line with Biden." Brexit news: Talks will be held with the US over a deal (Image: PA) 12.25pm update: 'Clueless!' Brexit chaos at EU ports due to bungling officials, fumes UK industry leader "Clueless" officials who don't understand the Brexit trade deal agreed between the UK and EU are partially to blame for delays at ports, an industry chief said today. Ian Wright from the Food and Drink Federation told MPs his members were suffering from delays when importing and exporting to the EU. He said those dealing with the paperwork at ports were unsure what was in the trade deal struck between the UK and EU. He told the Future Relationship with the European Union select committee: "It's important to understand the enforcers are as clueless about the provisions of some of the deal as those who are operating under it. "Our biggest single problem is nobody has absolutely had the chance to work with this deal, to practice the checks." 11.49am update: Thank God we left! EU rewards greedy Germany and France with huge chunk of Brexit funds Germany and France are set to pocket two of the largest payouts from the European Union's 4.5 billion Brexit fund. The blocs two largest economies will trouser 780 million between them this year to help adjust to the impact of the new trading relationship with Britain. Only Ireland, arguably the state hardest-hit by Brexit, is set to receive more 935 million than the two wealthy capitals. The European Council unveiled its Brexit Adjustment Reserve to help EU countries adjust to the new realities of the blocs relationship with Britain in the coming years. 10.38am update: Time for Irexit! Dublin was used and abused by EU during Brexit, admits ex-Irish diplomat Ireland was used by the EU during the Brexit negotiations and cannot rely on the bloc to have its best interests at heart now the UK has quit, a former diplomat has warned. Ray Bassett suggested the dramatic change in circumstances which has occurred since Ireland first joined in 1973 meant the country now needed to consider following Britains example. Mr Bassett, Irelands former ambassador to Canada, Jamaica and the Bahamas, was speaking during a webinar hosted by Yale University last night entitled Peacebuilding in the Wake of Brexit. The career diplomat said prior to the 2016 referendum he had hoped the UK voted to stay in the bloc. He said: My experience of the EU, particularly during whats known as the global crisis, when huge amounts of debts being pushed on the Irish state that we had not run up ourselves and we got very little support or help from the EU, very unfairly, made me feel when it comes to the crunch Ireland would not rate that highly in terms of the priorities of Brussels. We rated highly during Brexit negotiations because we were very useful to use the border issue to tie the British into Europe. So I felt at that stage that the balance of advantage of staying in the European Union that the British left was beginning to tilt away from that and towards a position somewhat like Norway or Switzerland or Iceland, where we were not under direct control of Brussels but we stayed very close to them in terms of the single market. Brexit: Fisherman says food is being 'rejected' due to export delay 10.25am update:EU disaster: Irish fishermen turn on Brussels as 93% of ships barred from UK waters Irish fishermen have lashed out at the EU after it emerged just 141 of their 1900 ships had secured permits for UK waters. Despite the UK and EU finally agreeing on a Brexit deal last month, the majority of Irelands fishing fleet has not been given full permits in order to enter Britains waters. Just over seven percent of their ships have been given temporary permits, with some fishermen labelling the situation as chaotic. The Irish government has also been criticised for failing to have a plan B to aid fishermen in the country post-Brexit. 9.47am update: British drivers to escape speeding fines in EU as Brexit loophole exposed Brexit may mean British drivers avoid speeding fines picked up in countries across the European Union due to a serious loophole. The UKs departure from the European Union on 31 December has ended existing deals regarding motoring offences which could see thousands of drivers escape punishment. The EUs cross-border enforcement directive no longer applies to road users which means information cannot be shared between borders. It means drivers who break speeding rules and are caught by cameras in France will not pay for penalties when they return to the UK. More than 44,000 British drivers were fined after being picked up by speed cameras in France last year, making UK drivers the most likely to be caught in the country. French officials are set to lose millions in lost fine revenue as a result of the new rule change. Brexit live: Brexit timeline (Image: Express) 8.37am update: Oh dear Michel! Barnier humiliated over desperate plot to become French president Michel Barniers apparent ambitions to replace Emmanuel Macron as Frances President have been mocked by a UK academic - who predicted the EUs Brexit frontmans total absence of any charisma whatsoever will scupper his chances. Mr Barnier was quizzed on the issue in the wake of the trade deal which he and UK counterpart Lord David Frost struck, after months of wrangling, at the end of last year, refusing to answer directly while stressing his belief that France needed unity, solidarity and justice. Dr Joseph Downing, an LSE Fellow in Nationalism at the LSEs European Institute, told Express.co.uk: The paradoxical thing about the current political situation is that I do not see as yet a credible challenger. And that I think is the other side of the coin when it comes to the system, which is quite worrying for French democracy. 7.52am update: ASOS expecting Brexit hit to sales boom Although the retailer reported a surge in sales over Christmas, the fashion chain is expecting a 15million hit to its shipments. This is as a result of the country of origin rules although it also received a 40million profit boost in the first-half of the financial year. It also reported a 23 percent increase in revenue to almost 1.4billion. ASOS chief executive, Nick Beighton, said: "We are really pleased with the strong performance we have delivered, which is testament to both the strength of our multi-brand model and the hard work of our people. "We have continued to execute well and deliver for our customers, whilst investing into growing our business and driving further efficiency through a strong operational grip.

He said: "We voted to take control of our own laws, taxes, borders and trade rules for the whole UK. Lets get on with"it. His comment came as Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform, has highlighted five key issues. Mr Grant posed five areas which still need to be addressed going forward: the Northern Ireland protocol, foreign policy co-operation, the UK's divergence on standards, the use of the dispute mechanism, and the future leadership of the Tory party and how that will shape the UK's relationship with the EU.

        Mysterious illness causes public panic in Indian district as hundreds hospitalised OFFICIALS in India are reportedly seeking to manage panic in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh due to a mysterious illness spreading in the district. Andhra Pradesh: Hundreds fall sick from mysterious disease So far, at least 450 people have been hospitalised and hundreds more affected by the illness. Covid-19 has been ruled out, and West Godavari district collector Revu Muthyala Raju said yesterday there was no sign of contagiousness up until that point, the Times of India reports. Trending Symptoms include fainting, seizures, and nausea. At least one person a 45-year-old man died of a heart attack following onset of the symptoms, according to reports. Water contamination was being investigated as a possible cause, with authorities probing 20 water supplies in and around the city of Eluru, where the outbreak was first reported, Reuters said yesterday afternoon. However, state health minister Alla Kali Krishna Srinivas claimed water contamination has been ruled out as a cause of the disease spread. Andhra Pradesh politician N Chandrababu Naidu has called for an impartial investigation (Image: Hindustan Times / SIPA USA / PA Images) Indeed, the chief ministers office claims people not linked to the municipal water supply have also fallen ill, AP news agency said. Patients are reported to have tested negative for Covid-19 or viral infections such as dengue and herpes. A district surveillance officer, Dolla Joshi Roy, said yesterday that 200 people have been discharged from hospital. Andhra Pradesh has already been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic (Image: Noah Seelam / AFP / Getty) He said at the time investigators did not know how the illness was spreading, but that it is very localised. He added: We tested everyone for Covid-19 and that came back negative, so we know it is not that. The Times of India adds various tests have almost established that organochlorine substances could be playing a part in the illness. Researchers have investigated whether water is the cause of the illness.

The state government of Andhra Pradesh has said: The causes of the outbreak are not known yet. Additionally, Indias federal health ministry said yesterday the illness has affected over 300 children. It stated: The children reported suffered from dizziness, fainting spells, headache, and vomiting. With more than 250 people now affected, the situation in #Eluru is worsening.

        Bible apocalypse: Burnt Pyramid notes reveal Newton's astonishingly complex occult study SIR ISAAC NEWTON'S fascination with biblical apocalypse, pyramids and the occult have been revealed in burnt fragmentary manuscript notes. Isaac Newton's theory may need 'modifying' suggests expert Legendary English mathematician, physicist, astronomer Sir Isaac Newton is rightly considered one of the greatest scientific geniuses ever. However, his wide-ranging research also led to an interest in alchemy, religion and even divine biblical apocalypse prophecies now laid bare in some of his stranger papers. Trending Newtons surviving notes, and manuscripts contain approximately 10 million words. These notes are part of Newton's astonishingly complex web of interlinking studies natural philosophy, alchemy, theology only parts of which he ever believed were appropriate for publication Sothebys And among reams of scientific and mathematical brilliance is evidence of another side of Newton, one his descendants were determined to shield from the public. Much of these mystical leanings would have been considered heretical-thinking in the 17th century. The texts, which are available at auction house Southebys, are literally fragments. Bible apocalypse: Burnt Pyramid notes reveal Newton's astonishingly complex occult study (Image: Getty) The fire was reportedly started by a candle that was inadvertently felled by Newton's dog, Diamond (Image: Getty) At time of writing, Newton's pages have attracted a leading bid of 280,000 ($375,000) (Image: Sotheby's) By quantifying this royal cubit, Newton believed he might be able to refine his own theories on gravitation. And through this he may even arrive at an unerringly accurate measure of Earths circumference. At the same time, Newton suspected he could gain far weirder geometrical insights, including predicting the apocalypse as forecast in the Bible. Gabriel Heaton, Sotheby's manuscript specialist, told The Observer: He was trying to find proof for his theory of gravitation, but in addition the ancient Egyptians were thought to have held the secrets of alchemy that have since been lost.

        Barring a last minute order by the central government to NTPC, or a temporary cash support by the Delhi government, large areas in eastern and central parts of the capital can expect 10-12 hours of daily power cuts within a week. This is despite the 7-8% fuel surcharge adjustment allowed by the Delhi regulator on Friday that, from March 15, will add R20-30 crore per month to the revenues of each of Delhis electricity distribution companies (discoms). While BSES Yamuna Power (BYPL), which supplies power to 13 lakh customers, has written to the Delhi power secretary saying it has no money to pay NTPC/NHPC their dues Rs 204 crore is due by the end of the month chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said the companies licences will be cancelled if they behave this way. There are lots of power companies in the country, he said, not just those belonging to Tata and Ambani. For now, it is only the Reliance Infrastructure-promoted BYPL, and not Tata Power Delhi Distribution (TPDDL), that has talked of impending power cuts. NTPC sources said if the dues were not paid within a few days, a disconnection notice would be served on BYPL. Under the law, a three-day notice is given before power supplies are cut off. NTPC officials said this problem of dues takes place each year but, in the past, the Delhi government has released some subsidy payments to alleviate the immediate crisis. This time around, however, the chief minister is adamant that no help will be extended. An immediate loan will help tide matters over, but only for a bit since the dues of the two BSES companies to various suppliers add up to Rs 5,236 crore. Of this, BSES Rajdhani Powers (BRPL) dues are Rs 2,846 crore, while BYPLs are Rs 2,390 crore. Two suppliers, DVC and SJVN, have already stopped supplies adding up to 259 MW. BYPLs total needs are 1,500MW and a third of this is supplied by NTPC. The two BSES firms owe Indraprastha Power Rs 1,226 crore, Delhi Transco Rs 913 crore and Pragati Power Rs 1,304 crore. DVC is owed Rs 645 crore and SJVN, formerly Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam, Rs 115 crore. Ironically, while the two BSES companies owe suppliers Rs 5,236 crore, Delhis customers owe them Rs 14,770 crore, according to the statutory advice given to the Delhi government by the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC). If you add TPDDL, this rises to Rs 19,505 crore. According to DERC, Rs 6,918 crore of regulatory assets were due till FY11 to all three discoms. In addition, the DERC letter says, the discoms two owned by BSES and one by Tata Power have projected regulatory assets of another Rs 12,600 crore till FY13. Regulatory assets are the difference between the cost and supply of electricity that are not passed on to customers, but are IOUs on the books of the discoms. According to a ruling by the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity in 2011, ideally all regulatory assets should be cleared within three years. In the case of Delhi, that would require a 20-25% hike in tariffs each year. In the current environment where tariff cuts are being made, from Delhi to Haryana to Maharashtra, however, that does not look possible. In a letter to Delhis power secretary, BYPL CEO Arvind Gujral has said that to ensure no disruption of service to our consumers and avoid any load shedding, we had made alternative arrangements through short-term purchases. However, that is no longer feasible. Both NTPC and NHPC, the letter goes on to say, will regulate power jargon for cutting off supplies till payments are made resulting in depletion of over 500 MW of power supply from early February 2014.

        In a shocking incidence of violence in South Delhi's Lajpat Nagar area, a student from northeast Nido Tania, was beaten to death mercilessly by as many as 8 men. Nido was the son of Arunachal Pradesh Health and Family Welfare Parliamentary Secretary Nido Pavitra. As a reaction to the gruesome incident and in protest against a spate of similar violence against students from the northeast, Lok Sabha member from Arunachal Pradesh Takam Sanjoy today demanded immediate arrest and trial of culprits involved in the murder. "Even after 48-hours of the incident the police failed to arrest the culprits involved in the crime, which exposed the discriminatory attitude of the people from mainland India towards the people of North East," Sanjoy said. This is not a new incident.... several such incidents have been reported earlier where students of NE are victimised and we have taken adequate steps to sensitize the people Even I raised the issue several times in the parliaments," Sanjoy said while condemning the incident. He said, he was shocked to learn that the Lajpat Nagar police delayed in registering the FIR and even did not arrest the culprits. Tania, a BA first year student of private university, had gone to Lajpat Nagar with his friends on Wednesday last and was looking for an address when a person at a sweetshop started mocking him. Following this, fight erupted between them during which Tania was assaulted with sticks and rods by eight men. Tania died of injuries in his room in Green Park Extension on Thursday. The police say his body was taken for a post-mortem at the AIIMS hospital. The postmortem report revealed serious internal injury. Meanwhile, All Arunachal Pradesh Students' Union (AAPSU) and All Nyishi Students Union (ANSU) along with several other organisations of the state condemned the incident and demanded the Delhi government to arrest the culprits immediately and to punish them severely.

        Diesel price was hiked by 50 paise per litre today, but there will be no change in petrol rates. The hike, effective midnight tonight, is excluding local sales tax or VAT. The actual increase will be higher and will vary from city to city. However, the price of non-subsidised cooking gas (LPG) cylinder, which customers buy after consuming their quota of 12 subsidised cylinders, was cut by Rs 107 on easing international rates. The price of diesel in Delhi will be hiked by 57 paise, including tax, to Rs 54.91 per litre, while it will cost Rs 63.23 a litre in Mumbai as against Rs 62.60 at present. The diesel price hike is in line with the January 2013 decision of the government to raise rates by up to 50 paise per month till such time that the entire losses on the fuel are wiped out, and prices made market determined. Announcing the price hike, Indian Oil Corp, the nation's largest fuel retailer, said that even after the 13th price hike since last January, oil companies are incurring Rs 9.24 per litre loss on sale of the fuel. Officials said there will be no change in petrol rates as current price of Rs 72.43 a litre in Delhi was almost in line with the cost. The 14.2-kg cooking gas cylinder that consumers buy beyond their entitled 12 bottles at subsidised rates, will now cost Rs 1,134, down from Rs 1,241, in Delhi. Non-domestic LPG rates were at the beginning of the year hiked by a steep Rs 220 per cylinder but have now been cut in line with softening of international oil rates. IOC said losses on LPG have come down to Rs 656 per 14.2-kg cylinder from Rs 762.50. Diesel price was last hiked by 50 paise on January 4. Since January 2013, diesel rates have risen by a cumulative Rs 7.76. "Even after the current increase, under recovery (loss) on retail diesel shall stand at Rs 7.40 per litre," IOC said in a statement. Besides diesel, IOC was losing Rs 35.76 a litre on sale of kerosene through Public Distribution System (PDS) and Rs 656 on sale of 14.2-kg subsidised domestic LPG cylinder. "For the year 2013-14, the Corporation is expected to incur under-recovery (revenue loss) of around Rs 73,700 crore on sale of three sensitive products and industry (IOC plus Bharat Petroleum Corp and Hindustan Petroleum Corp) would incur around Rs 1,42,000 crore," the statement added. On diesel, it said, the government had on January 17, 2013 authorised oil marketing companies to increase the retail selling price within a small range every month. "Accordingly, since then, retail diesel prices are being revised every month," it said.

        The Cabinet Committee on Political Affairs Thursday granted Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhis wish and raised the annual cap for subsidised cylinders to 12 from nine, undoing the reformist move to restrict LPG subsidy to deserving families with an eye on elections. The decision ensures subsidised cylinders for 97 per cent of the consumers and will increase the subsidy burden by Rs 5,000 crore. The ceiling of nine cylinders took care of the annual consumption of 89.2 per cent of the total 15-crore LPG consumers and only the rest had to buy additional cylinders at market price. Although the CCPA, prodded by Finance Minister P Chidambaram, agreed to restrict supplies to one cylinder per month to each consumer, sources said this constraint would also be removed as Petroleum Minister M Veerappa Moily later told the Prime Minister that the restriction would amount to rationing. However, in a setback to a scheme Rahul had touted as a game changer, the government put on hold direct transfer of LPG subsidy to the consumers Aadhaar-linked bank account. The issue will now be evaluated by a committee. This decision was taken following arguments by Defence Minister A K Anthony that field trials had shown that the scheme may not be working well as there were families that did not have an Aadhaar card or were unable to open a bank account. Moily said the direct benefit transfer for LPG (DBTL) scheme, where consumers in 289 districts in 18 states were to get cash in their bank accounts to buy cooking gas at market rates, had invited many consumer complaints. Although the scheme presently transfers the subsidy to all Aadhaar card-holders, its aim was to eventually provide subsidy only to deserving consumers. Expecting the objective to be followed through, an expert panel headed by Kirit Parikh had in October recommended that the cap on subsidised cylinders be reduced to six and the DBTL scheme be restricted to identified families based on an exclusion criteria within the next one year. Moily said that following the CCPA decision, each household will get one extra cylinder in February and March and from the next fiscal year beginning April, they will be entitled to 12 cylinders. Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tewari conceded that Rahuls suggestion about raising the LPG cap had been heeded while taking the decision but it is not linked to the polls. Neither is the decision to temporarily suspend the direct transfer of subsidy a fallout of the Aadhaar project landing in the Supreme Court, he added. Rahul Gandhi is a public representative. If he says something we take it very seriously. But the decision to hike the LPG cap or to temporarily suspend direct transfer of subsidy is not linked to the polls in any way. Neither is the decision to re-evaluate transfer of LPG subsidy any indication of the fate of the broader Aadhaar-based DBT paradigm, Tewari said.

        Without explicitly saying so, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), with Governor Raghuram Rajan in hot seat, has effectively begun to target inflation based on consumer prices, a dramatic shift in approach for a central bank that has struggled to manage the balance between growth and inflation. The RBI unexpectedly raised policy interest rates by a quarter percentage point to 8.00 percent on Tuesday. In doing so, it cited a "glide path" towards lowering the consumer price index (CPI) below 8 percent by next January and 6 percent a year later -- targets that were laid out in sweeping proposals released last week to revamp the way monetary policy is conducted in India. The core recommendation of the central bank panel headed by Deputy RBI Governor Urjit Patel was ultimately to bring down CPI inflation to 4 percent, plus or minus 2 percent. While that would make policymaking more predictable and less prone to government pressure, it also means rates would stay high for longer as CPI inflation now stands at nearly 10 percent the highest among major economies. Annual wholesale price inflation, long the favoured benchmark in India, stood at 6.16 percent in December. "It appears that RBI is taking the responsibility head-on, saying that this is going to be their primary objective," said Sonal Varma, economist at Nomura in Mumbai. "It's a game-changer," she said. RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan, who took office in September with an ambitious agenda, has long expressed an inclination towards adopting retail inflation as the main price gauge, although many bank-watchers did not expect him to take up the panel's recommendations so quickly. PRESSURE ON GOVERNMENT Inflation-targeting puts pressure on the government to meet its deficit-cutting targets, a challenge in a country prone to costly and inflationary spending programmes. "The fact that RBI actually came out with an inflation number of 8 percent over the next one year consistent with Urjit Patel's report in the policy review was a surprise," said Saugata Bhattacharya, chief economist at Axis Bank. Rajan stopped short of saying the RBI had adopted the panel's inflation recommendation. The RBI did, however, formally adopt the proposal to review monetary policy every two months, from eight times a year previously. "We want to bring inflation down and the Urjit Patel committee gives us a glide path to bring inflation down," Rajan said in a conference call with analysts on Wednesday. "And, as we examine the details of the Urjit Patel committee report, we will take up more issues. And, as I said, some issues will have to be taken up with the government. Some we can do on our own." Although the government has not taken an official stance on the reform proposals, Economic Affairs Secretary Arvind Mayaram last week said it was premature to make CPI the nominal anchor for monetary policy. While CPI is the benchmark in most countries, in India it has been plagued by the difficulty of gathering accurate data in a fast-growing economy with wide gaps between urban and rural spending patterns, a shortcoming statistics officials are working to address. By using CPI to set its policy interest rate, the RBI wants to ensure that real interest rates are positive in a consumption-led economy with low levels of savings. Retail inflation has been near or above 10 percent for three years. The RBI's change in approach comes as the ruling Congress party is focused on elections due by May, with opinion polls predicting it is headed for a loss after presiding over an economy that has stumbled to decade-low growth amid persistently high inflation. "Ultimately inflation is both a monetary...but also a political issue. We need political establishment to understand that it is important. I am confident that it will, and it is, actually," Rajan said.

More Paper mills have blamed rising waste paper cost for the recent increase in prices of kraft paper supplied to corrugated box makers. This is in contrast to the user industry blaming the paper mills for hiking prices by creating an artificial shortage. Lalit Garg, Chairman (Paper Committee), Material Recycling Association of India, said kraft paper prices have just now reached the pre-Covid level of Rs. 27 a kg for 18 bf (bursting factor) after falling to Rs. 19-20 during the pandemic due to weak demand. Paper mills had incurred huge losses as the waste paper inventory they were holding during the Covid outbreak was of high cost; besides, workers were given salaries during lockdown, and there were other overheads, he said. As demand revived over the last few months, waste paper prices started moving up, forcing paper mills to hike finished product prices to the pre-Covid levels of Rs. 27 a kg in most of the western region, he added. Earlier, the Federation of Corrugated Box Manufacturers of India said the unprecedented steep escalation of price of kraft paper by paper mills is the major hurdle while consuming industries, using boxes for packaging, are not willing to absorb the cost increase, making business unviable for box manufacturers. The price of waste paper, the key raw material, which was at $100 a tonne during pre-Covid times, has more than doubled to $200-220 a tonne. Even worse, he said, imported waste paper prices are still going up and expected to rise further in the near future as the waste paper generated and collected in developed countries such as the US and Europe has fallen substantially due to the pandemic. Chinese paper mills are stocking up the waste paper supplies available in overseas markets as Beijing has proposed a ban on waste paper imports from January. This has led to shortage of waste paper in global markets and escalation in prices. Chinese competition Both China and India import their waste paper primarily from the US and Europe for kraft paper manufacturing. Despite high raw material cost, all the paper mills are working at 100 per cent capacity and there is no possibility of them cutting production to push up prices, said industry insiders. The Indian paper market is highly fragmented and intensely competitive, with no single mill holding more than 1 per cent market share at the national level. There are around 800 paper mills, producing about 30 million tonnes of various grades of paper. The key raw material for kraft paper is waste paper, whose price has more than doubled to $200-220 a tonne from pre-Covid levels You have reached your weekly free article limit.

        More A delegation of 70 Ambassadors and High Commissioners visited the Bharat Biotech facility today at Genome Valley, Hyderabad, to study the progress being made in the development of Covid vaccine. They were taken ona tour of the facilities of vaccine makers Bharat Biotech and Biological Evans Limited by the Ministry of External Affairs. The team comprising High Commissioners and Government representatives of 70 countries across the world interacted with the team at Bharat Biotech and extensively discussed the progress of Covaxin. The project update on Covaxin was presented to the delegates by DrKrishna Ella, Chairman and Managing Director of Bharat Biotech. Covaxin is an indigenous Covid-19 vaccine by Bharat Biotech, being developed in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and National Institute of Virology (NIV). This vaccine is being developed and manufactured in Bharat Biotechs BSL-3 (Bio-Safety Level 3) bio-containment facility. Covaxin is a highly purified and inactivated vaccine, manufactured in a vero cell manufacturing platform, with an excellent safety track record of more than 300 million doses. Covaxin has been evaluated in approximately 1,000 subjects in Phase I and Phase II clinical trials, with promising safety and immunogenicity results. The Phase III human clinical trials of Covaxin began in November, involving 26,000 volunteers across India. This is Indias first and only Phase III efficacy study for a Covid-19 vaccine, and the largest Phase III efficacy trial ever conducted for any vaccine in India. Suchitra Ella, Joint Managing Director of Bharat Biotech, said: The development and clinical evaluation of Covaxin marks a significant milestone for novel vaccinology in India. It has garnered interest from several countries worldwide for supplies and introduction. It is an honour to have with us today all the distinguished Ambassadors of various countries. It not only makes us proud, but also reminds us that the world is looking up to India in the common fight against the deadly pandemic. Bharat Biotech has established an excellent track record of innovation with more than 140 global patents, a wide product portfolio of more than 16 vaccines, 4 bio-therapeutics, registrations in more than 116 countries and WHO pre-qualifications.

        More The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) needs to move towards creating an environment whereby for pull payments effected on behalf of merchants, the acquirer banks/Payment Aggregators (PAs) are not allowed to push consumers to pay for a payment service, according to a study by an IIT Professor. Pull payments entail a recipient (for example a merchant) requesting payment. Ashish Das, Professor, Department of Mathematics, IIT-Bombay, in his study, Charging Consumers for Merchant Payments, emphasised that consumers have a relationship only with the core merchant and the issuer bank (that issues cards). As such, it is grossly questionable for acquirer banks/ PAs to explicitly charge the consumers for merchant-initiated acceptance of digital payments, in the name of convenience fee, he added. An acquirer bank provides necessary infrastructure to the merchant to accept payment and facilitate acceptance payments through cards. PAs facilitate merchants to connect with acquirers. In the process, they receive payments from customers, pool and transfer them on to the merchants after a time period. While extant RBI regulations prohibit payment-surcharge for debit cards, Das pointed out that the RBI, in a recent regulation (Guidelines on Regulation of Payment Aggregators and Payment Gateways), seems to have allowed a fee (convenience fee, handling fee) to be imposed onto consumers by PAs. This acts as a surrogate for payment-surcharge, he added. In the guidelines, the central bank said: Information on other charges such as convenience fee, handling fee, etc., if any, being levied shall also be displayed upfront by the PA. Das felt that the government and RBI should encourage discounts in a merchants selling price/convenience feeswhen payment is through BHIM-UPI instead of any other payment modes that are relatively expensive. Like IRCTC that offers such explicit discounts for accepting payments through BHIM-UPI, prominent e-commerce merchants may take a cue to promote BHIM-UPI. This would boost BHIM-UPI volumes, he said. Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM) is a payment app that lets users make simple, easy and quick transactions using Unified Payments Interface (UPI). Ideally, expenditures to develop and promote asset-lite BHIM-UPI an apposite digital alternative to cash should be borne by the government and RBI. A budgetary support to the tune of 2,500 crore annually would on the one hand support BHIM-UPI and on the other render substantial savings on handling cash, the study recommended. Das underscored that a specific action-point on part of banks/PAs/payment networks/ RBI/ government should be to ensure that the no surcharge rule is strictly applied and enforced for all merchant payments. Public awareness against surcharging should be promoted, along with developing streamlined processes of reporting a payment-surcharge and getting appropriate redressal, he said. The study said RBIs Consumer Education and Protection Department needs to look into cases of merchants being overcharged by acquirer banks/PAs. These merchants are consumers availing the banking services, he added. You have reached your weekly free article limit. To get full access, please subscribe. Already have an account ?

        News World Americas Elijah McClain: Petition demanding justice for death of young black man detained by police reaches 2 million signatures 'Demand these officers are taken off duty, and that a more in-depth investigation is held', page reads Louise Hall Thursday 25 June 2020 00:48 0 comments Article bookmarked Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile Don't show me this message again A supporter holds up a shirt to call attention to the death of Elijah McClain in August 2019 in Aurora, Colorado during a news conference on the steps of the State Capitol (AP) An online petition demanding Justice for Elijah McClain , a young black man who died last year after being detained by Colorado police, has reached more than two million signatures. Sign this petition to bring justice for Elijah. Demand these officers are taken off duty, and that a more in-depth investigation is held, the Change.org petition reads. The 23-year-old died three days after he was put in a chokehold and then later sedated while being detained by police, The Sentinel Colorado reported. On 24 August 2019 a man called 911 to report a sketchy looking man wearing a ski mask waving his arms around at approximately 10.40pm, the outlet reported. The man who called police reportedly told officers that he did not feel that he was in any danger. The young man was said to have been walking home from a store to get bottled tea for a family member when he was confronted by officers, Denver7 reported. Colorado police approached McClain to question him and a struggle quicky ensued, reports said. An officer alleged that during the conflict the 23-year-old attempted to grab one of their holstered guns, The Sentinel reported. His family later told Denver7 that McClain would wear an open-face ski mask because he had anaemia and would sometimes get cold and was wearing earphones. He was not armed or suspected of committing a crime when he was stopped and later pinned to a nearby lawn, where he reportedly proceeded to repeatedly vomit and sob while handcuffed. At one point during the incident, an officer told McClain: If you keep messing around, Im going to bring my dog out and hes going to dog bite you, a comment which Police Chief Nick Metz later called unprofessional. When fire paramedics arrived, the young man was injected with 500 milligrams of ketamine to sedate him, a move that Aurora Fire concluded was appropriate based on the circumstances of the emergency scene, Aurora Fire Rescue Deputy Chief Stephen McInerny said. The Adams County Coroners Office could not determine the exact cause of McClains death, reports said. According to The Sentinel , the three officers who were involved were placed on administrative leave, but have since been reinstated to their regular positions. In November, District Attorney Dave Young announced that no criminal charges would be brought against the officers or medics involved in the arrest. It should not have escalated from a suspicious call to my son dying, Lawayne Mosley, McClains father told Denver7 at the time of his sons death. The renewed attention on the case comes in the wake of the killing of George Floyd , a black man who died while in Minneapolis custody after a white police officer pinned him to the ground by his neck for a prolonged period of time. The unnecessary death of Floyd and other black Americans such as Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor at the hands of law enforcement has sparked national civil unrest across the US and the world, with massive demonstrations taking place protesting police brutality against black Americans, systemic racism and racial discrimination. The new petition seeks to gather three million signatures to demand justice for McClain. Prosecutor Young has recently said he does not intend to re-examine the case, The Sentinel reported. The newspaper also said that the citys public safety committee has requested a neutral, independent review of the encounter, which officials have said is forthcoming.

        News UK Home News 'The guilt, the pressure and the relentlessness': Struggles to access childcare wreaking havoc on parent's mental health and work life 'I had to ask my work to leave me on furlough as I wasnt able to work my required hours with our pre-school only opening part-time. I have since been made redundant,' says mother-of-two Maya Oppenheim Women's Correspondent @mayaoppenheim Wednesday 26 August 2020 07:53 0 comments Article bookmarked Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile Don't show me this message again A report by Early Years Alliance found half of parents whose children are under the age of five said the government has not done enough to support parents gain access to childcare they require during the Covid-19 crisis (Getty) Parents say not being able to get hold of childcare in the wake of the lockdown is wreaking havoc on their mental health and work life, a damning study has found. A report by Early Years Alliance, which polled just over 2000 parents, found half of parents whose children are under the age of five said the government has not done enough to support parents gain access to childcare they require during the Covid-19 crisis. While a third of parents said struggles to find childcare since lockdown started being lifted on 1 June has had a detrimental effect on their work and over a quarter said such problems had harmed their mental health. The proportion of parents saying their work and mental well-being had suffered was far higher among those living in the most deprived parts of the country. Researchers found one in ten have been unable to access any formal childcare whatsoever since lockdown started easing in spite of needing such support. Victoria Benson, chief executive of Gingerbread, the leading single parent charity, told The Independent the studys findings resonate particularly strongly with single parents. Some 90 per cent of single parents are female. Ms Benson, a single parent who has been living with her six children during the coronavirus emergency, said: I had no childcare this summer and none in the lockdown. Im pretty desperate for them to go back to school next week. For my mental health and for their mental health. There is the guilt, the pressure and the relentlessness of looking after your children constantly in the summer holidays and in lockdown. For me, the difficulty is juggling work and looking after them. We are hearing from single parents who are getting no sympathy from employers who want them back at work. They have used up all their parental and annual leave and they have very little choice but to quit. Single parents usually rely on a patchwork of formal childcare from school, after school clubs, nurseries, and childminders, but many childcare providers arent providing their usual services. "This is worse over the summer. Many of the summer playschemes you would normally use havent reopened. I normally use play schemes but I havent been able to this year because ones in my area prioritise key workers children and disabled children and have also a reduced number they can take because of social distancing. Ms Benson said being a single parent is relentless as you do not get a break from your children adding that previous studies have shown flexible, affordable childcare is the single biggest enabler or blocker from single parents entering the workplace. Studies demonstrate women often shoulder the burden of high childcare costs and it is more frequently mothers who stop working to care for youngsters. There are more than two million families in England who have children aged under five with some 87 per cent of them using some type of formal childcare, according to government data. All children have been permitted to attend nurseries, pre-schools and childminders in England since 1 June but around a third of providers were yet to open their doors ahead of the summer holidays. This is due to a dearth of sufficient financial support from government and new safety measures in the wake of the global pandemic. Roberta Mitchell, who lives in Kettering with a two-year-old and a four-year-old, said: People have been expected to go back to work without the required care in place or facing reduced hours. "I had to ask my work to leave me on furlough as I wasnt able to work my required hours with our pre-school only opening part-time. I have since been made redundant and I feel that my inability to return to work could have contributed to this. Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Alliance, which represents, nurseries, pre-schools, and registered childminders, said: It is clear that much more needs to be done to ensure that the parents of young children are able to access the childcare they need. For this to happen, the government simply must provide greater financial support to the early years sector so that nurseries, pre-schools and childminders are able to keep their doors opens and provide the care and education that families rely on. With a quarter of providers fearing closure by next year, this situation is only going to get worse unless the government takes urgent action. As such, we urge the chancellor to use the upcoming Spending Review as an opportunity to commit to the investment that the early years needs to survive the Covid-19 pandemic and beyond. The alternative is a sector that may never recover from the impact of the pandemic, and hundreds of thousands of parents left without the support they need at the time they need it most. Tulip Siddiq, Labours Shadow Minister for Children and Early Years, raised concerns about the reports findings as she argued childcare forms a critical component of the economic recovery and "childrens life chances. Ms Siddiq added: Yet the sector is on the brink of collapse after years of underfunding. Having failed to ensure that childcare was available for many key workers at the height of the pandemic, the government is now asking parents to return to work without sufficient childcare support. This incompetence is putting working families in an impossible position and threatening jobs at a critical time for children and the economy. Labour has repeatedly called for targeted financial support to save the nurseries and childminders that families rely on now the government must listen. Lauren Balasco, a marketing manager who lives in Bristol with her two-year-old, said her son would not be getting his place back at nursery until September as a result of waiting lists and staff numbers. Victor Gazis, a father to a three-year-old and a five-year-old who lives in Exeter, said he was working around the clock to juggle childcare and work. He said: We are two parents working from home with a five-year-old on summer holidays and a three-year-old in nursery just two days a week. We have no other childcare options so our sons are basically doing stuff on their own until we have a break. We start work at 6am, spend time with our sons in the afternoon, then work until 11-12pm. Melissa Crossley, who lives in Manchester with her one-year-old and a four-year-old, said: Our children attend nursery two days a week and the other two days I work we used to be able to utilise family, as this option has now been taken away from us due to social distancing between households and in Greater Manchester, not being able to mix households. We are also currently unable to access further nursery time for our children due to lack of places at our current nursery, and the financial impact it would have on our family on having two children in nearly full-time childcare. If this situation continues we may have to make a decision to take a massive financial hit on our family either by one of us leaving employment for the children, or paying over double for childcare" More about Childcare Coronavirus gender equality Show 0 comments Comments Share your thoughts and debate the big issues Learn more About The Independent commenting Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.

        Culture TV & Radio News Ratched trailer Ratched fans urge Netflix to introduce trigger warning over scenes of child abuse, lobotomies and suicide Despite presence of warning over graphic content, fans have called for more Adam White @__adamwhite Thursday 24 September 2020 10:19 0 comments Article bookmarked Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile Don't show me this message again Ratched fans have urged Netflix to include a trigger warning before episodes that feature sexual abuse, lobotomies and suicide. The new series stars Sarah Paulson as Nurse Ratched, a character who originated in the novel One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest and was played by Louise Fletcher in the classic 1975 film adaptation. Ratched , from producer Ryan Murphy , explores the characters early life and her employment at a California psychiatric hospital. While fan reaction to the show has been positive, many have expressed shock that Netflix chose to not provide more substantial warnings over its content. A text box appears at the corner of the screen at the beginning of each episode, warning of scenes featuring sex, language, violence, injury detail and suicide reference, but some fans have argued that more should have been done. I hate that this show doesnt have a trigger warning, one viewer tweeted. It has no trigger warning, another viewer wrote. Ratched has child physical and psychological abuse. It isnt so graphic, but still very triggering. It actually kinda ruined the show [for] me. Independent Culture Newsletter The best in film, music TV & radio straight to your inbox every week Independent Culture Newsletter The best in film, music TV & radio straight to your inbox every week Another viewer provided fans with a list of potentially upsetting content since Ratched doesnt have an actual trigger warning, they claimed. I listed them all and the episodes where they appear, the viewer tweeted. Mostly are blood, gore, and murder, but theres lesbophobia and child abuse too. Sarah Paulson and Finn Wittrock in 'Ratched' (Saeed Adyani/Netflix) A good as Ratched is I think there should be a s**cide trigger warning at the beginning, another person wrote. Netflix has been at the centre of a series of controversies over claims it does not adequately warn viewers about upsetting content. In March, viewers of the teen drama All the Bright Places urged the streaming service to add a trigger warning to the film over its themes of suicide. 13 Reasons Why also came under fire in June over a bothersome and potentially traumatic plot twist in the series.

        The Queens hidden cousins: Who were Nerissa and Katherine Bowes-Lyon and why were they kept away from the royal family? New season of The Crown revisits the story of the sisters tragic lives Sarah Young @sarah_j_young Thursday 26 November 2020 07:10 0 comments Article bookmarked Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile Don't show me this message again Leer en Espaol The fourth season of The Crown gives fans of the royal family a detailed look at some of the most significant moments in their public and private lives. The new series begins as the 1970s are drawing to a close and takes viewers through to 1990, a period during which the royal family were involved in a number of major scandals, including the illicit relationship between Prince Charles and Camilla . However, the breakdown of the Prince of Wales marriage was not the most shocking incident the family had to deal with, as in 1987, it was discovered that Queen Elizabeth II had two hidden cousins: Katherine and Nerissa Bowes-Lyon. But, who were they and why were they kept apart from the royal family? Here is everything you need to know. Who were Katherine and Nerissa Bowes-Lyon? Katherine, born in 1926, and Nerissa, born in 1919, were the daughters of John Herbert Bowes-Lyon the brother of the Queen Mother and his wife, Fenella. The ties to the royal family mean they were first cousins of Queen Elizabeth II. The Crown shares photos of Katherine and Nerissa Bowes-Lyon (Netflix/The Crown) The sisters were born with severe learning difficulties and, following the death of their father in 1930, they were admitted to a mental health institution, the Royal Earlswood Hospital in Redhill, London, in 1941. INDY/ LIFE Newsletter Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trends every week INDY/ LIFE Newsletter Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trends every week Their cousins Idonea, Etheldreda and Rosemary the daughters of Fenellas sister, Harriet also had a similar disability, and were admitted to the state-funded hospital on the same day. Katherine and Nerissa had been listed in the 1963 edition of Burke's Peerage a reference book to the nations aristocracy as having died in 1940, when in fact they were both still alive. Nerissa Bowes-Lyons gravestone, 1987 (Rex Features) The condition was thought to have been hereditary and descended from their common maternal grandfather, Charles Trefusis, 21st baron Clifton. Nerissa died aged 66 in 1986 and was buried in a grave marked only with a name tag and serial number. Katherine stayed in the hospital until 1997, when it closed amid abuse claims, and then lived in another home in Surrey. She later died aged 87 in 2014. How are they portrayed in The Crown? Viewers are introduced to the sisters in episode seven of the fourth series. The episode begins with images of the Queen arriving at the Royal Variety Performance being shown on a TV in a hospital, as Katherine and Nerissa stare at the screen, before standing for the national anthem. The women, then in their sixties, proudly salute to the monarch, stopping only to take pills handed to them by a nurse. The Royal Earlswood Hospital, Redhill, (Rex Features) Their connection to the royal family comes to light in the episode when Princess Margaret , played by Helena Bonham Carter , learns of the sisters existence from a therapist, who asks the royal if she is aware of any relations struggling with mental health issues. Upon hearing of their struggles, Margaret is later shown confronting the Queen Mother about her knowledge of the sisters. Locked up and neglected. Theyre your nieces daughters of your favourite brother, she says. Its wicked and its cold-hearted and its cruel and its entirely in keeping with the ruthlessness which I myself have experienced in this family. Why were they kept away from the royal family? While many members of the royal family knew about Katherine and Nerissa, the majority believed they had died, including Queen Elizabeth II. However, it later transpired that their deaths had been falsified. But, why? At the time, there were fears that the sisters condition could threaten the social standing of the royal family due the stigma surrounding learning difficulties. In The Crown , the Queen Mother, played by Marion Bailey, tries to defend the decision to fake their deaths, telling Margaret that her brothers children paid a terrible price as she went from being the wife of the Duke of York to Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. Katherine Bowes-Lyon at the Royal Earlswood Hospital (Rex Features) At the same time my family, the Bowes-Lyons, went from being minor Scottish aristocrats to having a direct bloodline to the crown, resulting in the children of my brother paying a terrible price, she says. Their illness, their imbecility their professionally diagnosed idiocy and imbecility would make people question the integrity of the bloodline. Can you imagine the headlines if it were to get out? The idea that one family alone has the automatic birth right to the crown is already so hard to justify, the gene pool of that family better have 100 per cent purity. There have been enough examples on the Windsor side alone to worry peopleif you add the Bowes-Lyon illnesses to that, the danger is it becomes untenable. When did the public learn about Katherine and Nerissa? The sisters story came to light in 1987 , shortly after Nerissas death, when journalists discovered she was buried in a grave marked only by a plastic name tag and serial number. The hospital confirmed that Katherin and Nerissa were linked to the royal family following a report that appeared in The Sun . At the time, Buckingham palace said the Queen was aware of the report but added: We have no comment about it at all. It is a matter for the Bowes-Lyon family. Lady Elizabeth Anson, a niece of the two sisters, also issued a statement to the BBC on behalf of the Bowes-Lyon family saying that there was no attempt at a cover-up and that many family members had visited the sisters. The story reared its head again in 2011 when a Channel 4 documentary, titled The Queens Hidden Cousins , was made about the five Bowes-Lyon girls. The program meant a new generation of people were outraged by the scandal, as the documentary suggested the cousins had been treated callously by the royal family. After the documentary aired, a source close to Buckingham Palace branded the claims as utter lies. The Queen is very, very upset at the thought that this programme is being made which is just not true, the source said. Both Katherine and Nerissa were visited very regularly by their family but neither could speak, and throughout their lives had the thinking age of four years old. Did the royal family ever visit the sisters? The Channel 4 documentary claimed that Katherine and Nerissa had very few companions, and there is no evidence to suggest any of the royals ever visited. Speaking in the program, Dot Penfold, a former ward sister at the hospital where the sisters stayed, spoke of her sadness that they were not visited for years. The impression I had was that theyd been forgotten, she recalled. The Independent has contacted Buckingham Palace for comment.

Along with the virtual launch of pan-India vaccination drive on Saturday, PM Modi will also officially launch the Co-WIN app on January 16, sources told India Today TV on Wednesday. India has authorised two Covid-19 vaccines - indigenous Bharat Biotechs Covaxin & Serum Institute of India vaccine Covishield for emergency use.

After healthcare and frontline workers, priority will be given to those above 50 years of age and the under-50 population groups with co-morbidities numbering around 27 crore. The decision to launch Indias vaccination drive was taken after Prime Minister Narendra Modi reviewed the status of Covid-19 situation and vaccine preparedness. "After the detailed review, it was decided that in view of the forthcoming festivals including Lohri, Makar Sankranti, Pongal, Magh Bihu, etc, the Covid-19 vaccination will start from January 16, 2021," a government statement earlier said. "Emergency Use Authorisation or Accelerated Approval has been granted by the National Regulator for two vaccines (Covishield and Covaxin) which have established safety and immunogenicity," the government said.

        Jump to navigation Speak Now After Team Indias gallant effort to draw the Sydney Test match, the Border-Gavaskar Trophy is nicely set up for the finale in Brisbane in two days time, and former Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar feels that the historic series is now set up for India to win. Akhtar also added that after the valiant efforts in the Sydney Test, where India batted out 131 overs in the fourth innings to survive the game, if the visitors go on to win in the Brisbane Test, then this will be their greatest Test series win ever, and probably one of the best Test series win in the history of the game.  Now at the final stages (of the series), I think India have got it in them to win this series. Again, a last little push, where they will face issues, they have several injury concerns, but the Indian bench strength has to believe that they can do it, they need to give one last effort and they can win the series. If from this point onwards, India goes on to win this series, then that will be a big big victory. According to me, it will be the biggest series win in Test history. Again, if India win this, and I think that they are going to win it, then this will be one of the finest Test series that India could have ever played or could play in the next week or so. I think all credit goes to India because they have shown a lot of guts, a lot of guts. The whole team, spinner, tailenders, fast bowlers, Bumrah has put in all his energy, even got himself injured, but did not let the series slip away, Shoaib Akhtar said on his Youtube channel. Ravichandran Ashwin and Hanuma Vihari, despite getting injured in the game, batted out an entire session and played 289 deliveries between the two of them to draw the third Test match in Sydney.

        Jump to navigation Speak Now Australia head coach Justin Langer has jumped to the defence of captain Tim Paine, saying he wasn't forced to apologise for his widely-criticised conduct during the Sydney Test against India. Tim Paine called for an impromptu press conference a day after the drawn Test at the SCG and apologised for his behaviour, saying his leadership wasn't good enough and he had let the pressure affect him during the tense final day wherein Australia managed just 3 wickets before India sealed a dighting draw. Tim Paine was hurling abuses at India off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin, calling him dic****d at one point. Paine was sledging Ashwin continuously and also made some nasty remarks when the off-spinner was involved in a match-saving partnership with Hanuma Vihari who tore his hamstring during the heroic effort. Ashwin and Vihari batted 258 balls and remained unbeaten before the game was declared a draw on Monday at he SCG. Tim Paine was at the receiving end as he was "made to look like a fool" when he dropped as many as three catches during the final's days play. Justin Langer, speaking to the press on Wednesday, said Tim Paine has been a fine leader since he took over as captain from Steve Smith after the latter was banned over ball-tampering controversy. Langer urged critics to leave Paine alone, stressing that it's humane to let the situation to get the better out of you, at times. "He wasn't forced to make an apology. He felt remorseful and he came to us and said he wants to get on the front foot. I really respect him for it," Langer said. "For a bloke that's barely put a hair out of line, for three years as captain of Australia ... he got a bit frustrated for two minutes. The bloke is human, give him a break." When Sunil Gavaskar tore into Tim Paine Earlier on Monday, former India captain Sunil Gavaskar lashed out at Tim Paine, saying his conduct was not worthy of a national team captain. "I don't know I am not an Australian selector, but his days as captain are numbered. If you allow the Indian team to bat 130-odd overs without getting wickets, this is a very good Australian attack. The bowling changes, the field placements, everything could have made a difference to the result," Gavaskar told India Today. "He was more interested in talking to the batsman rather than his field placing and bowling changes. So I won't be surprised if there is a change in the Australian captaincy after the series is over."

        Jump to navigation Speak Now The Covid-19 vaccines are ready and have been shipped to several states across the country. The vaccination drive is just hours away now. However, reports indicate that though a majority are keen to get vaccinated, concern about the safety and efficacy of the vaccine is common among citizens. 56 lakh doses of the Covishield vaccine have been flown to 13 cities across India from Pune and taken to designated national and state-level stores amid tight security. A survey by YouGov has revealed that a large majority (68%) of urban Indians are likely to take the vaccine once its available. However, a quarter (24%) are unsure of their decision and only 8% are unwilling to take the jab. More than half (55%) of the urban population say they trust the Indian-origin vaccines more than those from developed nations like the US, UK and Russia. The survey has brought forth what the citizens think. People who said they are either unsure or unlikely to take the shot, are hesitant about the safety of the vaccine and want to review it first. SAFETY CONCERN REIGNS SUPREME Even among the ones willing to take the coronavirus vaccine, safety concern reigns supreme and two in five (41%) have said they will wait a few months before taking the shot. A third (33%), however, will get vaccinated as soon as it is available. A few would do so if vaccination is made compulsory by the government (13%) or by the employer/educational institutes (11%). FREE VACCINATION The report also highlighted that half of the surveyed respondents (50%) said they would want the government to arrange free vaccines for everyone in the country. Many (36%) feel the vaccine should be freely distributed only to the poor, elderly or those who are severely sick, while a few (14%) think those interested in getting the vaccine should pay for it. PRIORITY TO HIGH-RISK PATIENTS When asked about the order of priority, a vast majority feels patients suffering from high-risk diseases as well as senior citizens should be the top priority for the vaccination drive. Apart from these, frontline workers and people in the service industry (79% each) are also rated high in the list of vaccine priority. Public support for priority vaccinations of children and domestic helpers stands at a slightly lower percentage- 67% and 66% respectively, and preference for those below the age of 18 is lower- at 51%. Apart from concerns around the safety of the vaccine, there seems to be a growing concern among residents about the new Covid strain that was discovered in the UK.

        Home India BJP and Congress lock horns over newspaper advertisements in poll-bound Himachal Pradesh This Article is From Nov 01, 2012 BJP and Congress lock horns over newspaper advertisements in poll-bound Himachal Pradesh India Reported by Ketki Angre , Edited by Sabyasachi Dasgupta Updated: November 01, 2012 9:36 am IST Shimla: Newspaper advertisements are the latest bone of contention between the Congress and the BJP in poll bound Himachal Pradesh. Congress is crying foul over the advertisement the Dhumal government has put out to list its achievements during its tenure. Addressing a press conference in Shimla, Union Health Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad came armed with a nine-page press release to show how the Dhumal government ads were misleading. He said, "The state govt has taken central schemes which are fully funded by the Centre and has plastered their logo and photos alongside to appropriate them as if they are their own. This is not only unfortunate but also immoral." The Congress' 'grouse' list includes new hospital project in Baddi, a medical college-cum-hospital in Mandi, Rs. 767 crores released to the state under the National Rural Health Mission and even the policy of free medicines for which Rs. 10 crore has been released from the Centre. It also is miffed that the central govt's referral transport scheme, better known as 108 ambulance service is also being shown as an achievement of the Dhumal government. Mr Azad claims that 112 of these ambulances have been provided by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Govt of India and an additional 32 ambulances have been sanctioned for the current fiscal. The BJP, in response, claims these accusations are being made only to mislead the voters. Speaking to NDTV in Hamirpur, Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Prem Kumar Dhumal said, "This is not true. In fact we have put in more money over and above what the Centre has given. We had already announced free medicines scheme for patients as well. And it's in fact the Congress party that has appropriated schemes in the past. It picked up a scheme for rural electrification started by Atal Bihari Vajpayee and renamed it with Rajiv Gandhi's name calling it Rajiv Gandhi Gram Sadak Yojana." In the war of words, as both sides go all out to prove a point to claim credit, it seems neither is keen to find out if the schemes that were launched, have indeed benefitted those they were meant for.

        Home All India Spread Of Japanese Encephalitis In Poorvanchal Due To Lack Of Sanitation: UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath Spread Of Japanese Encephalitis In Poorvanchal Due To Lack Of Sanitation: UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath All India Press Trust of India Updated: May 01, 2017 4:07 am IST UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said a drive must be initiated to clean all the rivers. (File Photo) Deoria: Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday attributed the spread of Japanese Encephalitis (JE) in the state's eastern region to the lack of sanitation and cleanliness of water bodies. Most sources of water are polluted and sufficient steps have not been taken for their conservation, he said after distributing assisting devices to 'Divyangs' (differently abled) at a function. "Every year encephalitis, during the monsoons, claims hundreds of lives. The main reason for the spread of this disease is that people in the Poorvanchal region (in eastern UP) do not pay adequate attention to cleanliness," Yogi Adityanath said. A drive must be initiated to clean all the rivers, ponds and other water bodies in cities, towns and villages under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, the chief minister said. According to the WHO South-East Asia Journal of Public Health, UP contributed a fifth of the disease burden (20.4 per cent of cases and 18.7 per cent of deaths) during 1978-1987. The state's contribution increased between 1988 and 1997 to 24.3 per cent cases and 20.9 per cent deaths, and represented well over half of the total cases and deaths reported in the country between 1998 and 2009, it said. While the proportion of encephalitis cases reported from UP in 1997 was only 14 per cent, it started increasing dramatically from 1998 and in 2005, a major outbreak in UP contributed over 90 per cent of all suspected JE cases (6,061) - and over 89 per cent deaths (1501) - in the country, the journal said. During the four following years, 2006-2009; 80.8 per cent, 73.6 per cent, 78.5 per cent and 77.0 per cent of cases respectively, were contributed by Uttar Pradesh, it said.

        Home News Air Pollution Crisis: Delhis Air Quality In Severe Category For Third Consecutive Day Air Pollution Crisis: Delhis Air Quality In Severe Category For Third Consecutive Day The air pollution level in Delhi continued to be in severe category on the third consecutive day as several instances of firecracker bursting were observed in Delhi-NCR during New Year celebrations despite warnings issued by System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting (SAFAR) that any trigger in pollution could worsen the condition Air Pollution , Delhi , News | PTI | January 03, 2019 6:40 PM | - in Air Pollution , Delhi , News 0 The pollution level went up to 'severe' from 'very poor' with the air quality index being at 404 at 10 am New Delhi: For the third consecutive day, the air quality in the national capital was in the severe category on Tuesday. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data, the overall air quality index (AQI) in the national capital on New Years Day was 404, while the Centre-run System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting (SAFAR) recorded an AQI of 405, both of which are under the severe category. Nineteen areas in Delhi recorded severe pollution, while 14 witnessed very poor air quality, the CPCB data showed. Ghaziabad and Noida recorded severe air quality, while in Faridabad and Gurgaon recorded it was in the very poor category. The overall PM2.5 level (fine particulate matter in the air with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometer) was recorded at 280 and the PM10 level at 465 in Delhi, the CPCB said. The SAFAR has said the air quality would improve slightly provided that no additional local emissions are added on New Year eve . It said, Any new trigger in terms of additional local emission, particularly from open fire, pyrotechnic display, and fossil fuel burning may make air heavier and thick with low ventilation, and may lead to rapid deterioration in air quality to the severe-plus range. But despite warnings, several instances of firecracker bursting, before and after the time limit fixed by the apex court, were observed in Delhi-NCR during New Year celebrations. The SAFAR said the air quality in Delhi is likely to remain in the severe zone for the next two days as weather conditions are more adverse now. It said, The deterioration in speed of moisture-laden wind from the west may become fatal at this stage and any new trigger, in terms of local emission, particularly from open fires, firecrackers and (burning of) fossil fuels will fast deteriorate the air quality and keep it in the severe category. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) and SAFAR said the air quality is likely to remain in the severe category owing to low wind speed, which is highly unfavourable for dispersion of pollutants. The authorities warned that moderate fog and emissions during night hours may result in deterioration of the air quality and this situation may prevail till Wednesday. The SAFAR also pointed out that a consistent day-night trend is being observed for the past week. It said, During the night, a combination of calm wind and the colder condition is elevating the pollution level. In many locations, 24-hour rolling average (AQI) is touching severe levels for a few hours, whereas during the day the wind is picking up speed slightly and the temperature is increasing to keep the level in the very poor range. NDTV Dettol Banega Swachh India campaign lends support to the Government of Indias Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) . Helmed by Campaign Ambassador Amitabh Bachchan , the campaign aims to spread awareness about hygiene and sanitation , the importance of building toilets and making India open defecation free (ODF) by October 2019, a target set by Prime Minister Narendra Modi , when he launched Swachh Bharat Abhiyan in 2014. Over the years, the campaign has widened its scope to cover issues like air pollution , waste management , plastic ban , manual scavenging and menstrual hygiene .

It was in 2001, that the company forayed into the used car business and since then True Value has expanded its pan-India reach with a wide network of over 550 outlets spread across 268 cities. The strong sales in the pre-owned business can be attributed to the push that personal mobility has received in the past few years and now with the pandemic, there's a bigger need for it.

        Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. By Rich Calder September 27, 2010 | 10:40pm About 125 people gathered at a recent Bay Ridge rally of the Brooklyn Tea Party to protest a variety of hot subjects especially the planned Ground Zero mosque, according to a Brooklyn Ink report. As expected, the gathering was far from politically correct. When they say that all cultures are our friends, and anybody who supports having a border is racist, they undervalue us and do us a disservice, and quite frankly endanger the continuation of America, John Press, president of the Brooklyn Tea Party, said at the Sept 19 gathering along the 69th Street pier. Thats why weve got to replace multiculturalism with culturalism. The group, which was formed five months ago as an offshoot of similar Tea Party movements nationwide, also rallied against the presidents health care reform bill and increased government spending, according to the Ink. Press said the group, which meets every Sunday at Kosher Hut on Kings Highway, is growing in size. It only had 25 people attend its first rally in June to protest the planned Islamic Center in Lower Manhattan. *** Related story: Brooklyn Tea Party Protest (The Brooklyn Ink) Read Next Marist poll puts Cuomo way ahead Share Selection This story has been shared 100,707 times. 100,707 This story has been shared 72,066 times. 72,066 This story has been shared 49,565 times. 49,565 2021 NYP Holdings, Inc.

If the rookie right-hander needed any additional inspiration for his scheduled start Friday night in Pittsburgh, it came from watching Jacob deGrom manhandle the Cardinals on Thursday. He was lights out, Syndergaard said after deGroms one-hitter over eight innings with 11 strikeouts led the Mets to a 5-0 victory . He had great command of his fastball and he established that and let his offspeed pitches play off his fastball and he had a lot of success and was fun to watch. Syndergaard allowed one run over six innings against the Brewers on Sunday to earn his first major league victory and wants to go deeper against the Pirates. Team brass has not committed to Syndergaard beyond this start, as Dillon Gee nears a return from the disabled list. I want to get into the seventh [inning] and maybe even the eighth, Syndergaard said. John Mayberry Jr. delivered an RBI single with the bases loaded in the fourth inning, following his game-winning hit in the 14th on Monday. In that game, Mayberry singled with the bases loaded. Overall, Mayberry is batting .150. John is here to play against left-handed pitching and when he gets hits and drives in runs, I think they have got to help your confidence, manager Terry Collins said. We were talking the other day and the last two hits he had gotten drove in runs against right-handed pitching. The more he does that, the more confidence hes going to have and certainly the more times we can use him in big situations. Bobby Parnell and Vic Black were scheduled to make rehab appearances for Single-A St. Lucie on Thursday and then move to Double-A Binghamton for further work. Rafael Montero, who has been sidelined for three weeks with shoulder soreness, still hasnt resumed playing catch after a recent shutdown, according to Collins. The Mets are 17-6 at Citi Field, which equals the best home start in franchise history after 23 games. In 1971 and 72 the Mets also started 17-6 at home.

An online fundraising campaign, launched the day after he was suspended from the force in August over the death of Eric Garner, has raised $173,740 from more than 3,400 donors and has been shared 24,000 times, as of Wednesday afternoon. Pantaleo, a 13-year veteran who was pulling in $85,292 annually, was publicly fired by Police Commissioner James ONeill on Aug. 19, after the citys top cop sided with the departmental judge, saying Pantaleo could no longer effectively serve as a New York City police officer. Its a shame Mayor Dibozo and his puppets made the decision they did today. I am very happy to see the rally and support behind Officer Pantaleo, the organizer wrote that day. The day after the cop was canned, a competing GoFundMe for Garnerway Foundation popped up , promising to match every dollar raised for Pantaleo but has come nowhere near the Panteleos digital nest egg. The anti-Pantaleo fundraiser hadnt topped $500 as of Wednesday. Unfortunately, the fundraiser is not growing as fast as we anticipated, but despite challenges, we will achieve this goal, nonetheless, the competing fundraiser posted on Oct. 10. Together, we have decided to host events to reach this fundraising goal. Pantaleo sued the NYPD and ONeill last week in an attempt to get reinstated to the department. The former cop was found guilty of using a banned chokehold in the arrest of Garner following an administrative trial five years after the 43-year-olds death. Neither of the organizers could be reached for comment.

By Eileen Sullivan Video President Trumps lawyers continue their opening arguments before the Senate amid intensifying calls for witnesses to appear in the impeachment trial. Credit Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times Heres what you need to know: Trumps defense team ignores the Bolton bombshell. Trumps defense addresses Biden and justifies the need to investigate. The president was focused on getting more European support for Ukraine, his lawyers say. The defense briefly addresses Giuliani and then moves on. Starr opens oral arguments with an unexpected history lesson. Trumps defense team ignores the Bolton bombshell. President Trumps lawyers avoided on Monday any mention of a newly disclosed firsthand account from his former national security adviser, John R. Bolton, that directly undercuts one of the defenses main arguments. The New York Times first reported details from drafts of Mr. Boltons upcoming book Sunday night, including Mr. Boltons assertion that Mr. Trump said he wanted to continue a freeze on military aid to Ukraine until officials there helped with investigations into Mr. Trumps political rivals. Calls for witnesses intensified as a result, and three Republican senators Mitt Romney of Utah, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine indicated they might vote with Democrats to allow new witnesses to testify at the trial. Democrats need four Republicans for such a measure to pass. Mr. Romney told reporters on Monday, I think its increasingly likely that other Republicans will join those of us who think we should hear from John Bolton. The decision not to address Mr. Boltons explosive account hung over the lawyers first round of arguments as they repeated many of the same assertions offered over the past six months from Mr. Trump and the White House about why a hold was placed on military aid to Ukraine. Mr. Trump denied Mr. Boltons account on Monday. Mr. Bolton said weeks ago that he would testify at the Senate trial if he was subpoenaed to do so. Democrats have said Republican attempts to prevent new witnesses like Mr. Bolton from coming forward suggests they are covering up for Mr. Trump. Trumps defense addresses Biden and justifies the need to investigate. The presidents lawyers introduced the topic of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter, saying they had no choice but to address the need to investigate the Biden family, because Democrats raised the issue during the course of their arguments. We would prefer not to be talking about this. We would prefer not to be discussing this, Pam Bondi, one of Mr. Trumps lawyers, said on Monday. But the House managers have placed this squarely at issue, so we must address it. Lets look at the facts. Ms. Bondi raised Hunter Bidens relationship with Burisma Holdings, the Ukrainian gas company where he served as a board member, and questioned his qualifications to serve on the board. Mr. Trump has repeated variations of Ms. Bondis account and has stood by his belief that he was right to ask the Ukrainians to investigate the Bidens . Some Republican senators have suggested a witness swap of sorts, in which they would hear testimony from Mr. Bolton in exchange for testimony from Mr. Biden, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, and his son. The president was focused on getting more European support for Ukraine, his lawyers say. One of Mr. Trumps lawyers, Michael Purpura, said the presidents decisions regarding Ukraine were rooted in his desire to get European countries to pitch in more with aid. Scrutinizing, and in some cases curtailing, foreign aid was a central plank of his campaign platform, Mr. Purpura said. President Trump is especially wary of sending American taxpayer dollars abroad when other countries refuse to pitch in. Mr. Purpura left out details about Trump administration officials scrambling to find legal justification for freezing the military aid. An independent government watchdog concluded that Mr. Trumps decision to withhold the funds was against the law. The defense briefly addresses Giuliani and then moves on. Jane Raskin, a member of the presidents defense team, raised the topic of Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Trumps personal lawyer, and his role in the Ukraine affair. Ms. Raskin listed Mr. Giulianis accomplishments and called him a colorful distraction. She said the central role Democrats have affixed to him is undercut by their decision not to subpoena him to testify in the impeachment inquiry last year. (Democrats subpoenaed Mr. Giuliani to provide documents, but he did not comply ). In the midst of the White House efforts to pressure Ukraine, Mr. Bolton last summer described Mr. Giuliani as a hand grenade whos going to blow everybody up, according to testimony from one of Mr. Boltons aides . And it was in part the involvement of Mr. Giuliani, who was not a government official, in American foreign policy that prompted an intelligence officer to file a whistle-blower complaint that ultimately led to the impeachment of Mr. Trump. Starr opens oral arguments with an unexpected history lesson. Ken Starr, the dogged independent counsel during the impeachment of President Bill Clinton, resumed Mr. Trumps defense on Monday afternoon with a discursive and at times academic overview of the history of impeachment. Like war, impeachment is hell. Or at least presidential impeachment is hell, said Mr. Starr, who has been a regular guest on Fox News during the Trump administration. Mr. Trump added Mr. Starr to his legal team shortly before his trial began. Those of us who lived through the Clinton impeachment, including members of this body, full well understand that a presidential impeachment is tantamount to domestic war, but thankfully protected by our beloved First Amendment, a war of words and a war of ideas, said Mr. Starr, who resigned as independent counsel in 1999 over the intense politicization of the investigation. Mr. Starrs choice to dwell on history appeared to ignore criticism from some Republican senators that the House managers spent too much time last week on the rehashing of historical references and past legal precedents to justify removing Mr. Trump from office. Mr. Trumps other lawyers have steered clear of any suggestion that the proceedings will leave an indelible mark on the nations history. Advertisement Continue reading the main story

        The Best of 2020 Best Comedy Best TV Shows Best Books Best Movies Best Albums Advertisement Continue reading the main story Supported by Continue reading the main story Books of The Times In Serious Noticing, James Wood Closely Reads Chekhov and Others Including Himself By Parul Sehgal Jan. 14, 2020 Credit... Sonny Figueroa/The New York Times Amazon Apple Books Barnes and Noble Books-A-Million Bookshop Indiebound When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Early in his career, James Wood, the commanding, occasionally contentious literary critic at The New Yorker once anointed the last critic used a pseudonym. He published serious pieces under his own name, but his hackwork, as he has called it short, 50-word reviews churned out for money were the work of one Douglas Graham (Woods two middle names). I thought often of Douglas Graham while reading Serious Noticing, a new collection of Woods writing. Two voices vie in this book. There is the voice we recognize in the reviews: the professor, stately and composed, guiding the reader through forensically close readings of the text, pointing out fictions innovations and revolutions the failed privacies of Chekhovs characters, the unwrapped consciousness in Virginia Woolfs novels. The other voice pitched about half an octave higher, blunt, reedy, very winning pops up in the essays. I began to think of it as belonging to Douglas Graham, pragmatic Graham, who once paid the bills and still gives it to us straight. The reviews and essays settle into a rolling rhythm, pleasing counterpoints. In the criticism, Wood stands at the front of the classroom, extolling that serious noticing, an attentiveness to language and the world that can serve as a small stay against oblivion. In the essays, Graham unravels all such certainties, lightly trolling: How absurd that Im paid to do this work! How long will the money last? Wood luxuriates in D.H. Lawrences joyously messy sentences. Graham upbraids himself for being such a good boy, and for never daring to write such sentences himself. Wood is haunted by fiction and its effects; two reviews in the collection, written 20 years apart, analyze the same short story, Chekhovs The Kiss. Graham, meanwhile, daydreams about giving his books away. Wood contemplates the death of God; Graham, the overdose of the Whos Keith Moon. In the introduction, Wood mentions that he was taught how to read by a deconstructionist who would badger the class with the same question: What are the stakes here? The two voices mingling in this collection give a beautiful, moving sense of the stakes of criticism as Wood has practiced it, vigorously, without interruption for 30 years: What does it mean to do this work well, and what does it add to the world? What has it added to his life? Woods latest novel, Upstate, which follows a deeply depressed philosopher, dramatizes these questions about the relationships between analysis and fulfillment. He writes in that book: If intelligent people could think themselves into happiness, intellectuals would be the happiest people on earth. Wood had his deconstructionist, and many of us have had James Wood. No modern critic has exerted comparable influence in how we read. So many popular notions of what constitutes a telling detail or plausible character, or why we think stories move us, flow from his criticism and his stylish craft manual, How Fiction Works. His take is passionately partisan, and hes faced charges of being wedded to realism and intolerant of fiction that doesnt pursue his designated aims. Image James Wood That classical, very consistent taste (which critics would term narrow) can occlude how surprising, open and deeply unusual his criticism can be. Who else would describe criticism as modesty or as simplicity and near-silence? For all the institutional authority Wood possesses, one of the great pleasures he takes in criticism seems to be the opportunity for self-forgetfulness. He speaks admiringly of artists who merge with their work: Glenn Gould becomes the piano, Moon becomes the drums; Naipaul is colonized by his characters; Chekhov transforms into them more completely than any writer before him. Wood writes as if enmeshed in the text itself; registering shifts in point of view and perspective with seismographic precision. Serious Noticing pulls from Woods previous collections, including The Broken Estate, The Fun Stuff and The Nearest Thing to Life. There are essays on his lodestars (Chekhov, Bellow, Woolf) along with newer discoveries (Jenny Erpenbeck, Elena Ferrante). He includes two sharply critical pieces a review of Paul Auster and his famous takedown of hysterical realism, the hectic, information-besotted novels of the early aughts, including Zadie Smiths White Teeth. There are, however, none of the slashing reviews that first made his name. This may be the wisdom of middle age the reverse of the red sports car, Wood has said. Im less hung up on greatness than I used to be. And maybe correspondingly, Im a less severe judge than I used to be. A less severe judge perhaps, but to go by these reviews, a keener reader and a clearer writer. The aggressive plumage and swagger of the young critic has fallen away mercifully. (From an early piece on Melville: In this book meaning is mashed up like a pudding. The Godhead is indeed broken into pieces. Truth is kaleidoscopically affronted.) In his two readings of Chekhovs The Kiss, 20 years apart, the argument doesnt alter but the tone does, from the gavel-pounding verdict (this was his revolution) to a new note, of wonder, as Wood relishes Chekhovs details (See, there they are, talking to us: the poplar, the lilac and the roses). At least three deaths haunt this book: the deaths of Woods in-laws and the death of his mother. There is stark personal accounting here; the serious noticing of the title has as much to do with the self as with texts. He is taking stock of childhood, and his decades in America, and in doing so he performs a kind of literary criticism on his own life. What it misses, he realizes, is the pungency of detail, the pungency of his childhood in England, when every object seemed invested with meaning: the sound of the trains at night, his mothers shoes. He recalls his father listening to Beethoven sonatas his father, who in his later years lived without any music at all. The CD player had broken, and he told no one. It was too expensive to fix, he thought, and he was too busy, too anxious, caring for Woods mother. Little in sanitized adult American life, where Wood is productive and content, seems to have the same kind of purchase as those bygone places and people, that bygone music. He does not tell us he does not need to where those vivifying details can still be found (the poplar, the lilac and the roses). To notice is to rescue, to redeem, Wood writes. To save life from itself. Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The Kansas City Chiefs will face the San Francisco 49ers for Super Bowl LIV. Chiefs fans regularly use a tomahawk chop to urge on their beloved team: Is it offensive?

But the team has shown little appetite for preventing its supporters from doing the tomahawk chop. Credit... Jamie Squire/Getty Images By Jeremy Engle Jan. 31, 2020 Find all our Student Opinion questions here. Native American names and symbols have long been used by all types of American sports teams at the professional, college and high school levels, such as the Cleveland Indians, Atlanta Braves and Washington Redskins . But facing pressure and protest, many teams are now changing their nicknames and mascots . This Sunday, the Kansas City Chiefs will face the San Francisco 49ers for Super Bowl LIV. It is likely that at some point during the game, Chiefs fans will begin their favored cheer: the tomahawk chop. How will you feel seeing this gesture and hearing its accompanying chant? Do you think it is a disrespectful and perpetuates negative stereotypes? Or is an acceptable way to celebrate and rally ones beloved team? In Celebrating the Kansas City Chiefs, the Chop Divides, John Eligon writes: The night was winding down at The Rieger, an upscale casual restaurant in Kansas City, and a couple of Denver Broncos fans in town for a game last month were standing at the bar, engaging in some friendly ribbing with supporters of the hometown Chiefs. At some point, the Broncos fans walked through the dining room. Thats when a Chiefs fan responded with a gesture as synonymous with the team as its red jerseys: He sliced his hand through the air in a chopping motion while bellowing a rhythmic chant. Slowly but surely, most of the 50 or so diners dropped their silverware, turned toward the rivals and joined in, chopping the air in unison and chanting in a rising chorus that filled the restaurant. This citys beloved football team has left an unmistakable imprint on the local culture, whether it be the tradition of wearing red on the Fridays before games or the custom of modifying the national anthems final line to and the home of the Chiefs before kickoff at Arrowhead Stadium. But perhaps the most indelible symbol of Chiefs fandom is one that unifies believers and divides others: the tomahawk chop. Now that the Chiefs are on one of the biggest stages in sports, contending in the Super Bowl for the first time in 50 years, there is new scrutiny on the tradition. For many fans, the chop and its accompanying chant a pantomimed tomahawk motion and made-up war cry, also employed by fans of the Atlanta Braves, the Florida State Seminoles and Englands Exeter Chiefs rugby team are a way to show solidarity with their team and to intimidate the opposition. But to many Native Americans locally and afar and others, the act is a disrespectful gesture that perpetuates negative stereotypes of the nations first people and embarrasses a city that fancies itself a hub of culture and innovation in the Midwest. It doesnt show K.C. pride, said Howard Hanna, the chef and owner of The Rieger, describing his dismay as the impromptu chop unfolded in his restaurant. It makes us look stupid. The Chiefs have largely escaped the hottest embers in the national debate over American Indian mascots and imagery in sports. Their name does not evoke a slur like the Washington Redskins, and their mascot is not a red-faced caricature like Chief Wahoo, the logo that the Cleveland Indians began phasing out two years ago. The organization has worked with Native Americans over the past six years to reconsider and reform some of its traditions. That dialogue resulted in the teams discouraging fans from dressing in Indian regalia and asking broadcasters to refrain from panning to those who disregard the request. The team makes informative announcements about Native American history and tradition during some games, and a group of Natives hands out literature at the stadium. The team sometimes invites Native people to bless the drums that are ceremonially beaten before games. The Chiefs have shown little appetite, however, for preventing their supporters from doing the chop. The Arrowhead Chop is part of the game-day experience that is really important to our fans, Mark Donovan, the team president, recently told The Kansas City Star. The article continues: The local Indian communitys views on the tomahawk chop run the gamut, Crouser said, from those who think it is fine to others who are offended. As an organization, part of our mission is to empower Indian people, said Crouser, who is a member of the Standing Rock Sioux. And things like the tomahawk chop dont empower Indian people. Its still very stereotypical and mocking of an entire race of people. A survey of Native Americans conducted by researchers at the University of Michigan and the University of California, Berkeley, and set to publish next month found that around half of respondents were bothered or offended when sports fans did the tomahawk chop or wore Indian headdresses. Opposition was even greater among those who frequently engaged in Native traditions, with 65 percent saying the chop bothered them, according to the report, which will appear in the academic journal Social Psychological and Personality Science. Other research suggests that even when Natives see mascots or imagery as positive, they can still do psychological harm, damaging the self-esteem and ambitions of American Indian youth. Theres no way that the use of Natives as mascots is honoring, said Stephanie Fryberg, a University of Michigan professor who is Tulalip and worked on the survey. Thats an illusion. The tomahawk chop causes ambivalence among some Chiefs fans they understand why Native people might find it offensive, but say they do it to celebrate their team, not to demean Indians. Several fans said they would have no problem giving up the chant and replacing it with something else, but that the team would have to lead that effort. Joyce Parker, 65, cringed as she admitted that she does the chop at games. Its just that caught-up-in-the-moment group joy, said Parker, a fan from Prairie Village, Kan., a suburb that is a 10-minute drive southwest of Kansas City. Yes, I feel bad about it. Students, read the entire article, then tell us: Is it offensive for sports teams and their fans to use Native American names, imagery and gestures? Do you think Chiefs fans should end their use of the tomahawk chop? According to the article, many Chiefs fans say that they use the chop to celebrate their team, not to demean Indians. However, Gaylene Crouser, a member of the Standing Rock Sioux, argues that it is mocking of an entire race of people. Which viewpoint is more persuasive? Does it matter what an individual fan intends with their use of the gesture? Or is it the impact of the chant on others that is important? Have you ever witnessed or participated in a tomahawk chop at a sporting event? If yes, how did you experience the cheer? Do you enjoy it? Were you embarrassed or offended by it? Does reading the article make you reconsider the meaning of that gesture? Do you think you would ever engage in the tomahawk chop at a sporting event in the future? Should teams, like the Washington Redskins, Cleveland Indians and Kansas City Chiefs, change their names? Explain.

Video The New York Times has obtained and verified video showing the moment a Ukrainian airliner was hit in Iran. Credit Credit... Screenshot from video By Julian E. Barnes , Eric Schmitt , Anton Troianovski and Natalie Kitroeff Published Jan. 9, 2020 Updated Jan. 10, 2020 WASHINGTON American and allied officials said on Thursday that they had intelligence that missiles fired by Iranian military forces were responsible for the downing of a Ukrainian jetliner and the deaths of all aboard this week in Iran, most likely by accident. The disclosures suggested that the deaths were a consequence of the heightened tensions between Washington and Tehran that have played out since an American drone strike killed a top Iranian general last week. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada , citing a preliminary review of the evidence, called for a full investigation to be convinced beyond all doubt. The jetliner was carrying 63 Canadians among its some 176 passengers and crew. We recognize that this may have been done accidentally, Mr. Trudeau said at a news conference in Ottawa. The evidence suggests very clearly a possible and probable cause for the crash. President Trump , speaking earlier at the White House, said only that he suspected that the downing of the plane was the result of a mistake on the other side. Senior American officials were more forthcoming, saying that they had a high level of confidence in their findings. American intelligence agencies determined that a Russian-made Iranian air defense system fired two surface-to-air missiles at the plane, one official said. And video verified by The New York Times appeared to show an Iranian missile exploding near a plane above Parand, near Tehrans airport, the area where the jetliner, Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 , stopped transmitting its signal before it crashed. Those aboard the plane most likely faced horrifying final moments, starting with an explosion as the missiles detonated just outside it, sending shrapnel and debris spiraling through the fuselage. The plane turned back toward the airport, then began its uncontrolled descent toward the ground. American satellites, designed to track missile launches, detected the firing of the Iranian short-range interceptor. United States intelligence agencies later picked up Iranian communications confirming that the system brought down the Ukrainian airliner, officials said. An initial Iranian report released on Thursday said that the plane, bound for the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, was in flames before it hit the ground but sent no distress signal. A security camera captured its impact: first the predawn darkness, then a series of blinding bursts of light in the distance, followed by a storm of burning debris in the foreground. Even before world leaders and American officials confirmed the intelligence assessment, the mysterious circumstances of the disaster had raised suspicions that a missile brought down the airliner. The crash occurred hours after Iran launched a barrage of ballistic missiles at American military targets in Iraq, and Tehran, bracing for possible American retaliation, readied its ample air defense system. After Iran began firing missiles early on Wednesday in retaliation for the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani , international airlines rerouted flights away from Iran, and the Federal Aviation Administration barred American carriers from the airspace in the region. The new information about the tragic mistake with its air defense systems raised questions about why Iranian authorities had not stopped flights in and out of Tehran. Iran denied that its military was responsible for the crash of the plane, a Boeing 737. Ali Rabiei, an Iranian government spokesman, called it a big lie and blamed the accusations on psychological warfare against Tehran. The United States is making the pain of the families worse, Mr. Rabiei said in a statement. Iranian officials questioned the Western account, saying the plane would have exploded if hit by a missile. The air defense system used Wednesday, however, is designed to explode near aircraft, creating shrapnel that takes a plane out of the sky, rather than directly hit it.

The board assigned an investigator to the crash, a spokesman said on Thursday evening. Iranian authorities recovered the planes black box flight data recorders, but they were damaged by the crash and fire, the Iranian report said. That raised the possibility that some of the information stored in them electronically had been destroyed, but investigators can retrieve useful data even from damaged recorders. Iran also invited Boeing, the jets manufacturer, to help investigate the black box, a government spokesman said, according to Irans official news agency, IRNA. Boeing is supporting the N.T.S.B. in the investigation, said a spokesman, Gordon Johndroe. Sanctions against Iran prevent Boeing from contacting its government without an export license, the people said, and Mr. Johndroe said the company is applying for one. Canadian investigators were also arranging to visit the crash site, a senior government official said. Ukraine was negotiating with Iran to allow investigators to search the site for possible rocket fragments, Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, told Censor.net , a Ukrainian news outlet. Ukrainian officials want to find out the causes of the tragedy, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said in a videotaped address released on Thursday. We will definitely find out the truth. We will conduct a detailed and independent investigation. Mr. Zelensky also sought to pre-empt criticism of the Ukrainian authorities for allowing the flight to take off soon after the Iranian attacks on American targets in Iraq. He said that Tehrans airport had been operating as usual at the time, noting that other European airlines were taking off and landing. Image Relatives of the flights crew at a memorial on Wednesday in the Boryspil International Airport outside Kyiv, Ukraine. Credit... Valentyn Ogirenko/Reuters Evidence gathered by American and allied intelligence contradicted Irans denials. The American militarys Space-Based Infrared System , which relies on satellites in various orbits to track the launch and flight path of ballistic missiles, detected the missile launch. While American missile defense sensors are primarily meant to defend against long-range launches, they can often detect launches of air defense systems, including those designed to work at low altitudes, officials have said. On Wednesday, American officials combined the information from the satellites with intelligence from intercepted calls to determine what brought down the plane. The infrared system had also detected the antiaircraft missile fired by Russia-supported separatist fighters in eastern Ukraine in 2014 that brought down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, officials said at the time. All 298 people aboard were killed. Russia first sold Iran the air defense system which NATO calls SA-15 and Russia refers to as Tor in 2005, prompting American protest . The Iranian military could have positioned the system, which is designed to operate at medium to low altitudes and intercept both aircraft and guided weapons, to defend the airport if officials believed the United States military was intending to counterattack after Irans ballistic missile strikes. Three to four people operate the system, tracking nearby aircraft by radar. But determining friendly civilian aircraft takes skill, and mistakes are possible, particularly in charged situations. Echoing Mr. Trudeau, Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain confirmed that intelligence pinned the shoot-down on the Iranian government and that it may well have been unintentional. Mr. Trump was more evasive earlier in the day. Somebody could have made a mistake on the other side, Mr. Trump said. It was flying in a pretty rough neighborhood and somebody could have made a mistake. Image Debris from the Ukrainian passenger jet on Wednesday outside Tehran. Credit... Arash Khamooshi for The New York Times His reluctance to assign blame may be an attempt to avoid inflaming tensions at a time when both governments were taking steps to de-escalate the military confrontation of recent days. The revelations about the intelligence prompted accusations that the American militarys killing of General Suleimani set off a chain of events that led to Iran accidentally downing the jet. This is the responsibility of the Iranians, said Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the senior Democrat on the Armed Services Committee. But the context was a situation in which they were preparing themselves for a possible attack by the United States. This might not have happened two or three weeks ago. The crash in Iran also came at a difficult time for Boeing. The 737 Max, a new version of the 737 that was downed in Iran, has been grounded for 10 months after two deadly crashes caused in part by new software on the plane. The crisis is consuming Boeing, which ousted its chief executive late last year and is temporarily shutting down the factory that makes the Max this month. Had investigators found that mechanical problems caused the crash in Iran, it could have raised new questions about the safety of the companys aircraft. On Wednesday, before the cause was determined, Boeings interim chief executive, Greg Smith, sent an email to employees expressing condolences for the victims and pledging to cooperate with investigators. The safety of our people, products and services, and all those who fly on what we build, is of the greatest importance to all of us at Boeing, he wrote, according to a copy of the email reviewed by The Times. Thank you for your ongoing focus on our values, including safety, quality and integrity. At Boryspil International Airport near Kyiv, where Flight 752 had been due to land, grieving flight attendants tended to candles set on the floor in front of a makeshift memorial to the nine crew members who died. A flight attendant named Tatyana, who declined to give her last name because she was not authorized to speak to the news media, said she visited the memorial on Wednesday evening to pay her respects. Of course there were concerns, risks to those flights, she said. We took this responsibility upon ourselves when we joined the airline to be ready for anything to happen. Julian E.

At precisely the moment when we should be rallying our allies to stand beside us and hold the line against threats, Donald Trumps shortsighted, America First dogmatism has come home to roost, Joe Biden said during a foreign policy speech in New York. Credit... Hilary Swift for The New York Times By Katie Glueck and Shane Goldmacher Jan. 7, 2020 Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Tuesday delivered a forceful and detailed critique of the Trump administrations escalation toward Iran as he sought at every turn to highlight his own commander-in-chief credentials and to evoke the stature of a president. The former vice president, speaking from Pier 59 in New York against a backdrop of American flags, delivered a stern warning about President Trumps stewardship of international affairs and painted a grim picture of the dangerous landscape in the Middle East. Mr. Biden cast Mr. Trump as a hypocrite who preaches an inward-looking foreign policy but operates using unsteady, bellicose tactics, and faulted the president for bringing the nation dangerously close to war after an American drone strike that killed one of Irans top military commanders, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani . Because he refuses to level with the American people about the dangers which he has placed American troops and our diplomatic corps, personnel and civilians, as well as our partners and allies, or demonstrated even a modicum of presidential gravitas, I will attempt to do that, said Mr. Biden, who is one of 14 candidates seeking the Democratic presidential nomination. That starts with an honest accounting of how we got where we are. Hours after he spoke, Iran launched more than a dozen ballistic missiles against United States military and coalition forces in Iraq, according to American military officials. Whats happening in Iraq and Iran today was predictable, Mr. Biden said at a fund-raiser in the Philadelphia area on Tuesday night, citing the chaos thats ensuing from Mr. Trumps approach to the region. He added, I just pray to God as he goes through whats happening, as we speak, that hes listening to his military commanders for the first time because so far that has not been the case. One of Mr. Bidens rivals, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, opened a rally on Tuesday night at a packed house in Kings Theater in Brooklyn by telling the crowd about the Iranian strikes. My three brothers all served in the military, she said. At this moment, my heart and my prayers are with our military and with their families in Iraq and all around the world. But this is a reminder why we need to de-escalate tension in the Middle East, Ms. Warren continued. The American people do not want a war with Iran. The crowd thundered in approval. Image Senator Elizabeth Warren said at an event on Tuesday at Kings Theater in Brooklyn, The American people do not want a war with Iran. Credit... Calla Kessler/The New York Times All of the leading Democratic candidates have excoriated the Trump administration over its posture toward Iran. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has used the moment to highlight his longstanding antiwar credentials and to point out, obliquely and explicitly, Mr. Bidens vote to authorize the war in Iraq. And former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., a military veteran, has emphasized his personal experience in a war zone. In Mr. Bidens telling, the chaos America now confronts heightened threats, chants of death to America once more echoing across the Middle East, with Iran and its allies vowing revenge was stoked by Mr. Trumps withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal that was negotiated under the Obama administration. He described a series of subsequent provocations and challenges for which the Trump administration, he argued, was unprepared, even as he also said that he had no illusions about Iran, led by a government that he said threatened American interests. But the decision to kill General Suleimani may well do more to strengthen Irans position in the region than any of Suleimanis plots would have ever accomplished, he said, arguing that Mr. Trump owed the nation answers but had delivered only tweets, threats and tantrums. General Suleimani was designated by the United States as a terrorist, and was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American troops. Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper said Tuesday that attacks orchestrated by General Suleimani had been expected within days, adding that he has the blood of hundreds of Americans, soldiers, on his hands and wounded thousands more, and many Republicans, including some who are typically critical of Mr. Trump, said the action had made the nation safer. Democrats, too, including Mr. Biden, have said General Suleimani should face justice. But other officials have questioned whether an attack was in fact imminent. Mr. Biden said that if there was an imminent threat that warranted this extraordinary action, Americans should receive an explanation and the facts to back it up. At precisely the moment when we should be rallying our allies to stand beside us and hold the line against threats, Donald Trumps shortsighted, America First dogmatism has come home to roost, Mr. Biden said. He went on to add, We are alone now. Were alone and well have to bear the cost of Donald Trumps folly. On the campaign trail, Mr. Biden has emphasized his decades-long record in international affairs and extensive relationships abroad, highlighting a contrast with his rivals in the Democratic field, who have largely been focused on domestic matters throughout the race. In New York, the setting appeared designed to conjure the White House briefing room: Mr. Biden spoke against a blue backdrop before a room full of reporters. He walked in to the clicking of multiple cameras and offered his own prescription for the path forward, calling for cleareyed, hard-nosed diplomacy grounded in a strategy thats not about one-off decisions and one-upsmanship. Mr. President, he urged, you have to explain your decision and your strategy to the American people. Thats your job as president, Mr. President. Not Dear Leader. Not Supreme Leader. Democracy runs on accountability, and nowhere is it more important than the power to make war and bring peace. Mr. Biden, who has faced renewed scrutiny of his foreign policy record and especially his Iraq war vote, also appeared to misspeak at times, referring to Iran when he apparently intended to say Iraq, and he appeared to say that the current perilous situation was unavoidable, when excerpts from the speech circulated before the appearance used the word avoidable. Still, Mr. Bidens advisers and allies hope that the gravity of the moment will further crystallize the importance of defeating Mr. Trump in the minds of voters, and polls continue to show that Democrats believe Mr. Biden has the best chance to do so, though other candidates have also polled strongly against the president in hypothetical head-to-head matchups. The current crisis just reinforces how high the stakes are in this election, Mr. Biden said at a fund-raiser earlier Tuesday, during which he also envisioned a Senate dynamic in which one could see Mitch McConnell changing some ideas or being more how can I say mildly cooperative, even as Mr. Biden also discussed the imperative for Democrats to win back the Senate, revoking Mr. McConnells title as majority leader. Also on Tuesday, on ABCs The View, Ms. Warren said that by killing General Suleimani, Mr. Trump had moved us close to the edge of war. Suleimani was a bad guy, she said, but the question is, whats the right response? The job of the president of the United States is to keep America safer, she added. And having killed Suleimani does not make America safer. As evidence, Ms. Warren cited the withdrawal of American citizens from the region because of safety concerns and said Mr. Trump had tweeted threats of war crimes by threatening to strike cultural institutions . We need a president who actually has good judgment, and is willing to follow through, she said. Pressed on whether she believed General Suleimani to be a terrorist, Ms. Warren said: Of course he is. Hes part of a group that our federal government has designated as a terrorist. As for how she would handle foreign policy in the Middle East, she said, It is the responsibility of the commander in chief not to ask our military to solve problems that cannot be solved militarily. The point is not whether or not Iran is a bad actor they are, she added. But the question is: What are the right steps for the president? Use our diplomacy. Use the back channels. De-escalate and get Iran to the negotiating table. Matt Stevens contributed reporting from New York. Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The ease and poise with which Khalid was navigating both the ideologies of left and ultra left strains of political thoughts indicated that his position in the overall power matrix was very, very close to the very top, it alleged. According to the charge sheet, Khalid allegedly held meetings with his associates at different places since January wherein the conspiracy to Chakka Jaam and the large scale communal violence was hatched. Delhi Riots: Umar Khalid, Sharjeel Imam charged with conspiracy in supplementary sheet It is pertinent to mention here that accused Umar Khalid had been provided personal security officers (PSOs) by Delhi Police after there was an attempted firing incident near Constitution Club in New Delhi where he had gone to attend a meeting called by United Against Hate. However, as the investigation of this case has brought on record, accused Umar Khalid did not take the PSOs when he was meeting his associates for conspiratorial meetings, it said. A Delhi court had taken cognisance of the supplementary charge sheet on Tuesday. It further alleged that the conspiracy grew in an organic manner from the formation of a group called Muslim Students of JNU (MSJ), an overtly communal seed that was sown after the CAB (Citizenship Amendment Bill) had received the assent of the Cabinet to the subsequent formation of Jamia Coordination Committee and finally the emergence of Delhi Protest Support Group (DPSG), which provided a secular facade and naxal genes of violent resistance to an otherwise radically communal agenda. It said compared to "Khalid in 2016, Khalid in 2020 was unapologetic proponent of political Islamic extremism who was expressing his designs through chosen commanders while maintaining symbiotic linkages with left and ultra left strains of political thought. The connectivity of Umar Khalid with the wider kaleidoscope of activists, accused and co-conspirators pointed to his centrality in the entire saga of events... The ease and poise with which Umar Khalid was navigating both the ideologies indicate that his position in the overall power matrix was very, very close to the very top. The police said that the systematic interrogation of Khalid has brought the investigation closer to the roots and the pinnacle of the conspiracy. Let Umar Khalid step out of jail cell, court tells jail authorities Umar Khalid was the convergence point of the twin lines of pan-Islamica and Ultra-Left anarchism which had incubated, nurtured and propagated the common conspiracy, all squarely aimed at violent subjugation of the Government established by law. Nivar turns into very severe cyclonic storm, TN airport shut | Oneindia News The total flow of the conspiracy, as it related to the deliberate acts of gross communal violence orchestrated under the watch of Umar Khalid, funneled out from the Delhi Protest Support Group (DPSG) as the executive facade, the charge sheet claimed. It said that further investigation was being carried out to bring to light the roles played by the top minds of these two violent strains of human thoughts for their role in this common conspiracy. Communal violence had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after clashes between Citizenship (Amendment) Act supporters and its protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.

President Xi sent a message to Biden to congratulate him on his election as US president, becoming one of the last major leaders to congratulate the Democratic presidential candidate. Promoting healthy and stable development of China-US relations not only serves the fundamental interests of the people in both countries, but also meets the common expectation of the international community, Xi said in his message, according to state-run Xinhua news agency. GOP Senate silent as Biden seeks swift Cabinet votes Xi said he hopes that the two sides will uphold the spirit of non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation, focus on cooperation, manage differences, advance the healthy and stable development of China-US ties, and join hands with other countries and the international community to promote the noble cause of world peace and development. On the same day, Chinese Vice President Wang Qishan sent a message to Kamala Harris to congratulate her on election as US vice president-elect. The Chinese presidents message came as US President Donald Trumps government authorised President-elect Biden to begin a formal transition process. However, Trump has not yet conceded, and vowed to persist with efforts to change the vote, which have so far proved fruitless. China initially hesitated to congratulate Biden after Republican incumbent President Trump refused to concede. However, China on November 13 shed its hesitation and congratulated Biden and his running mate Harris for their victory, saying that it respects the choice of the American people. "We have been following reactions on the US elections from both within the US and the international community, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a media briefing here on November 13. "We respect the American peoples choice and we extend congratulations to Biden and Harris and we understand that the result of the US presidential elections will be determined following the US laws and procedures, Wang said. Trumps four years in power were the worst phase in China-US relations as the ruling Communist Party of China headed by President Xi struggled to deal with what Chinese officials say is the most elusive and unpredictable American leader ever since former US President Richard Nixon in 1972 established ties with the Communist nation. 98.9 per cent not in favour of me conceding to Biden: Donald Trump Nivar turns into very severe cyclonic storm, TN airport shut | Oneindia News During his tenure, Trump pushed aggressively on all aspects of US-China ties, including with his relentless trade war, challenging Chinas military hold on the disputed South China Sea, its constant threats to Taiwan and branding coronavirus as China virus after it emerged from Wuhan in December last year. Chinese strategic experts said Biden entering the White House may provide an opportunity for breakthroughs in resuming high-level communication and rebuilding mutual strategic trust between the two major countries.

        Scroll They can beat Australia in their own den: Shastri backs India's 'fabulous five' quicks to shine The India coach said his teams pace unit was the best in the world, despite being likely to be without the injured Ishant Sharma. Scroll Staff Nov 25, 2020 08:56 am File photo of Ravi Shastri | Ravi Shastri / Twitter Coach Ravi Shastri believes Indias pace attack can conquer Australia in their own den in the upcoming Test series between the worlds top two sides. Indias quick bowlers, led by Jasprit Bumrah, will face a powerful home batting line-up including David Warner and Steve Smith when the four-Test series begins on December 17. But Shastri said his teams pace unit was the best in the world, despite being likely to be without the injured Ishant Sharma who is receiving treatment India for a muscle tear. His absence does make a difference to the fast-bowling department, but then we have the capacity among the young bowlers to deliver, Shastri told Indian magazine Sportstar. Shastri dubbed Bumrah, Mohammed Shami, Mohammed Siraj, Umesh Yadav and Navdeep Saini the fabulous five, adding, Yadav has the experience. Saini is young and fast. Bumrah one of the best in business. Shami is raring to go. Siraj is an exciting prospect. You put up runs on the board and watch these fast bowlers hunt the opposition. They can beat Australia in their own den. Australia last week overtook India at the top of the inaugural world Test championship when the scoring system was amended due to the coronavirus pandemic, but Virat Kohlis men enjoyed a historic first Test series win Down Under on their last tour in 2018-19. Shastri is confident his team can stay focused on and off the pitch during the tour, which requires travel bubbles and isolation because of the pandemic. You have to back your self-belief and take the field with a fearless attitude, said the former India all-rounder. We are prepared and let me remind you that never has cricket, or a cricket team, faced such a situation since the Second World War. We are going through the drills of staying mentally tough and approaching the series by taking one step at a time. India, who are undergoing a two-week quarantine in Sydney, are hoping senior batsman Rohit Sharma and Ishant will be able to join them for the Tests. Rohit, who led Mumbai Indians to their fifth Indian Premier League title on November 10, has a hamstring injury and will miss the limited-overs matches which start on November 27 with the first of three one-day internationals. Shastri said that if the pair were not able to board a flight within a few days then the strict 14-day quarantine rules would make it difficult for them to play the first Test. Kohli will lead the side in three ODIs, three Twenty20s and the opening Test a day-night game in Adelaide before taking on paternity leave and returning home.

        EUROPEAN FOOTBALL Champions League: Last-gasp wins take Juventus, Chelsea and Sevilla into last 16, Barcelona cruise They are the first teams to make it out of the group stage, doing so with two games to spare. AFP Nov 25, 2020 09:21 am AFP Juventus, Chelsea and Sevilla all claimed last-gasp wins as they qualified for the Champions League last 16 on Tuesday, while Martin Braithwaite grabbed a double in Barcelonas 4-0 victory at Dynamo Kiev as they also secured a place in the knockout rounds. They are the first teams to make it out of the group stage, doing so with two games to spare, on a night which saw Erling Braut Haaland, Neymar, Cristiano Ronaldo and Bruno Fernandes all get among the goals. There was no Lionel Messi for Barcelona, with the Argentine rested for the trip to Ukraine, but Ronald Koemans side got the job done to make it four wins from four in Group G. All the goals came in the second half, with Sergino Dest opening the scoring before Danish striker Braithwaite added another and then converted a penalty to make it 3-0. On as a substitute, Antoine Griezmann wrapped up the win on the night young centre-back Oscar Mingueza, Brazilian midfielder Matheus Fernandes and teenage American winger Konrad de la Fuente were all blooded in the first team. Weve achieved our objective, said Koeman. We looked hungry and scored four goals. Important players were able to rest and the youngsters deserved their minutes. Morata, Giroud strike late Juventus joined Barcelona in qualifying from Group G but the Italian champions needed a stoppage-time header by substitute Alvaro Morata to beat Ferencvaros 2-1 in Turin and seal their progress. Albanian international Myrto Uzuni put the Hungarians ahead but Ronaldo drilled in the equaliser before half-time, meaning he has scored in 15 consecutive Champions League seasons. Chelsea are through from Group E after edging Rennes 2-1 in France, with Olivier Giroud coming off the bench to head in an injury-time winner. Serhou Guirassy had cancelled out Callum Hudson-Odois breakaway opener. Last seasons Europa League winners Sevilla will not get to defend their trophy as they advanced to the last 16 of Europes elite club competition and did so with a 2-1 win over Krasnodar in Russia, in a rare game played before a sizeable crowd. Ivan Rakitics drilled strike put the Spaniards in front only for the Brazilian Wanderson to equalise, but Munir El Haddadi won it for Sevilla five minutes into added time. Sevilla and Chelsea are level on 10 points but Frank Lampards side go to Spain next week, when the winner will secure top spot. Manchester United are in pole position in Group H after a first-half Fernandes brace set them on their way to a 4-1 victory over Istanbul Basaksehir that made up for a 2-1 defeat in Turkey last time out. The opener by Fernandes was a thunderous strike from outside the box, while the second was a tap-in after a horrible error by Mert Gunok in the away goal. Marcus Rashford added a penalty, but there was a fightback from the away side, with Deniz Turucs free-kick crossing the line before David de Gea could claw it away. Edin Visca crashed a shot off the bar, but Daniel James made sure of the victory on the counter-attack. Its a Champions League night at Old Trafford, youd expect them to enjoy themselves, United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said of his team. We scored some very nice goals, Im pleased. Haalands frightening record Solskjaers side are three points clear of both Paris Saint-Germain and RB Leipzig, after an early Neymar penalty gave the French side a 1-0 win over their German visitors. PSG go to Old Trafford next week. Borussia Dortmund need just one more point to qualify from Group F following a 3-0 win over Club Brugge as the prolific Haaland netted twice either side of a Jadon Sancho free-kick in Germany. Haaland has 16 goals for the season, and has now scored 16 Champions League goals in just 12 appearances Messi had two goals and Ronaldo none after the same number of appearances. Erling is a fantastic player. He works hard on and off the pitch and he deserves everything thats coming his way, said Sancho. In the groups other game Ciro Immobile was on target twice, including from a penalty, as Lazio beat Zenit Saint-Petersburg 3-1 in Rome, a result which eliminated the Russians. Marco Parolo also netted for Lazio, with Artem Dzyuba scoring for Zenit. Support our journalism by subscribing to Scroll+ . We welcome your comments at letters@scroll.in .

        Research Digest What is the extent of caste segregation in Indian villages today? New data gives us an idea The extent of intra-village segregation in Karnataka is greater than the local black-white segregation in the American South. Naveen Bharathi , Deepak Malghan & Andaleeb Rahman Nov 25, 2020 11:30 am Figure 1: Amminabhavi, Dharwad District, c. 1950. (Digitized and remastered by authors using original sketch from Spate and Learmonth, 1954, p. 200) Even a beginning student of rural India with only a passing familiarity with its complex social organization can wax eloquent about one stylized factthe near-perfect segregation of residential space by caste and religion. Introductory textbooks have immortalized spatial segregation as a constitutive feature of social life in agrarian India. When BR Ambedkar famously characterised the Indian village as a sink of localism, and a den [of] narrow-mindedness, he was partly railing against such spatial segregation in the Indian countryside. Figure 1: Amminabhavi, Dharwad District, c. 1950. (Digitized and remastered by authors using original sketch from Spate and Learmonth, 1954, p. 200) Generations of detailed ethnographic research has documented how residential space in rural India is not only segregated , but actually mirrors the hierarchical ordering of caste groups . Figure 1 depicts residential segregation in Amminabhavi, situated on the outskirts of the city of Dharwad in Karnataka, and made famous by Spate and Learmonth (1954) as the quintessential example of spatial organization in village India. This large village shows how Dalits (the formerly untouchable caste groups shown as Harijans in the original figure) are consigned to the periphery of the village. The dominant landholding castes occupy the center of the village. Other worker castes in the figureTalwars, Shepherds, and Washermenare also relegated to the spatial margins. The village headman and his kin occupy the best land parcel and live in a palatial manor house. Even as cartographic accounts detailing Amminabhavis around India have proliferated, we do not yet have a systematic quantification of the degree of segregation rural India. Consequently, quantitative studies of rural political economy are besieged with an important missing variable. While the actual extant of intra-village segregation remains unknown, the Indian national census data records the presence of multiple hamlet clusters in select districts across the country. Our summary is derived from preliminary findings of an ongoing project to develop the first ever largescale quantitative measurement of intra-village spatial segregation in India. We use micro-data from a survey conducted by the Government of Karnataka in 2015 (GOKS) to measure intra-village segregation. GOKS represents the first census-scale enumeration and coding of detailed caste ( jati ) and religion data since 1931, and the first ever micro dataset that allows for a quantitative characterization of intra-village spatial segregation. The data includes demographic information for all rural residents in Karnataka (approximately 36 . 5 million residents) from over 26,000 villages. We measure intra-village segregation by comparing the actual spatial arrangement of households in a village with the hypothetical case where the households are randomly distributed in the village. Figure 2 describes how we measure intra-village spatial segregation. Panel A of the figure depicts an actual village hamlet in the GOKS dataset. The forty households in this village are drawn from four different jatis . Panel B shows these households arranged in a random order. To compute intra-village segregation, we simply compare the runs, or unbroken sequence of households that share a social identity in the actual village with the hypothetical random ordering. We adapt the well-established runs test metric that has previously been used to measure street-level micro-segregation to more than two categories to account for the multitude of jati and religion groups in a village. The actual village has nine runs, while a random arrangement of the same forty households corresponds to twenty-one expected runs. The fewer the actual runs relative to the hypothetical random organization of space, the greater the measured value of segregation. Figure 2: Wald-Wolfowitz Micro Segregation. Amminabhavi representation in Panel C uses the eight-fold administrative mapping of endogamous jati and religion groups. Halli in Panels A and B use endogamous jati and religion groups. Each square represents an individual household in all three panels. The 2,500 houses in the Amminabhavi grid are represented row-wise. Authors computation (data from GOKS). Panel C in Figure 2 shows the 2015 spatial distribution of households in Amminabhavi as recorded by GOKS (we have shown the eight-fold administrative mapping of jatis ). Even as Amminabhavi is on the cusp of being designated urban, its spatial demography has remained remarkably stableseventy years after it was first immortalized as the exemplar of spatial organization in village India. Our intra-village segregation metric is measured on a 01 scale with a 0 indicating perfect integration and 1, perfect segregation. Figure 3 shows the distribution of this intra-village (micro) segregation metric across all villages in Karnataka for jatis , census groups, as well as religion. The boundary between the touchables and untouchables is especially stark as seen by a high degree of segregation between SCs, STs., and others (census groups). As a point of reference, Amminabhavi in Figure 3 has an intra-village micro segregation score of approximately 0 . 55. The extent of intra-village segregation in Karnataka is greater than the local black-white segregation in the American South that continues to influence residential patterns to this day. Figure 3: Distribution of Micro (intra-village) Segregation for jatis, census groups and religion in Rural Karnataka. 0 indicates perfect integration and 1, perfect segregation. Figure reproduced from Bharathi et al. (2020). Our analysis also shows that the extent of intra-village segregation is uncorrelated with other metrics used to measure demographic diversity, so that not accounting for such segregation can potentially bias extant quantitative characterizations of rural political economy in India. Limited evidence suggests that accounting for intra-village segregation is important for characterizing Indias rural political economy. Local public goods placement , or even hydro-geological distribution of groundwater resources within a village intersect with intra-village segregation. Beyond the political economy of rural India, the measurement of social distance has been one of the central founts of modern social sciences. For example, Georg Simmel argued that the stranger is, above all, a product of prevailing social distances that are explicitly spatialthe geometry is a constitutive feature of social distance. In societies with clearly defined status ranks, the classical relationship between contact and prejudice is shaped by Simmels geometry. If inter-group solidarity is tied to inter-group contact, our analysis shows that spatial segregation remains one of the most significant barriers.

        indian medical care Khichdification: IMA demands withdrawal of move allowing Ayurveda doctors to perform surgery The medical body said that the move should not be seen in isolation, referring to other government decisions legitimising Mixopathy. Scroll Staff Nov 25, 2020 01:11 pm Updated Nov 25, 2020 03:08 pm File photo used for representation. | Pexels [Licenced under CC BY 2.0] The Indian Medical Association on Tuesday issued a statement demanding the withdrawal of a newly-introduced provision authorising post-graduate Ayurveda practitioners to perform general surgery related to ophthalmology and dental procedures. Terming the decision as a deceptive camouflage of mixing the systems of medicine, the medical body rejected a clarification issued by the Ayush ministry on the matter. It is nothing but a blatant attempt at mixopathy and Khichdification of medical education and practice, the Indian Medical Association asserted. Last week, the Central Council of Indian Medicine the regulatory body for the study and practice of Ayurveda in India amended the Indian Medicine Central Council (Post Graduate Ayurveda Education) Regulations, 2016, to include the regulation to permit post-graduate students of Ayurveda to receive training and practice of shalya and shalakya. While the former term refers to general surgery, the latter is related to diseases of the ear, nose, throat, head, eye, and oro-dentistry. After the move was condemned by the Indian Medical Association , the Ayush ministry issued a statement clarifying that the amendment was specific to 58 surgical procedures only. #IMA demands withdrawl of the notification of the amendment regulations of Postgraduate #Ayurveda Education @PMOIndia @drharshvardhan @MoHFW_INDIA @narendramodi pic.twitter.com/yBI08T6K1K Indian Medical Association (@IMAIndiaOrg) November 24, 2020 In its statement released on Tuesday, the Indian Medical Association suggested that the move cannot be seen in isolation, and listed other similar decisions taken by government bodies. Highlighting the chain of decisions by the government, the release mentioned the National Education Policy 2020, which speaks of medical pluralism and lateral entry legitimising mixopathy and the One Nation, One System policy to officially mix all systems. All the six hundred odd medical colleges of India are expected to turn out Hybrid doctors of a Khichdi medical system by 2030, the medical body said. The statement also raised questions on whether Ayush drugs would be used for medical procedures like anaesthesia, post-operative care, and infection control. Will it be a throwback to the 19th century septic wards? the release enquired. How will the government find adequate resources to create new infrastructure from nowhere to fend for this modern medicine B team? It added that the body was prepared for the ensuing long drawn struggle to resist the move and that the central working committee of the Indian Medical Association has been called for an emergency session.

        Streaming Why Beginning on Mubi is a film you cannot miss Dea Kulumbegashvilis directorial debut is Georgias submission for the Best International Feature Film category at the Oscars. Rashid Irani 5 hours ago Beginning (2020) | Mubi Cinephiles would do well to store the name of the director of Beginning in their memory banks. Dea Kulumbegashvili, a 30-something Georgian filmmaker, has crafted one of the most hauntingly beautiful first features since Werner Herzogs Signs of Life back in 1968. A real love for the medium irradiates Kulumbegashvilis debut, which tackles complex themes and concerns a conflicted couple isolated from society as well as themselves. Utilising a minimalist aesthetic comprising lengthy single takes (a characteristic largely absent from movies nowadays), the script, co-written by Kulumbegashvili and producer and lead actor Rati Oneli, is a bold departure from established storytelling norms. The 130-minute film is being streamed on Mubi. Imbued with fierce emotional intensity, the narrative gets underway with a spectacular opening sequence set in a prayer hall where a marginalised community of Jehovahs Witnesses has congregated to listen to their religious leader (Oneli, appropriately overbearing). Before his sermon is over, the place is set upon by unknown extremists. The burning of the building recalls a similar protracted scene from Andrei Tarkovskys final film The Sacrifice (1986), in which flames engulf the protagonists house. In a series of startling ellipses, the minister is elided almost completely from the rest of the film. This then shifts the focus to his conflicted wife Yana (Ia Sukhitashvili, delivering one of the most subtly harrowing performance ever committed to film). Brutalised both psychologically and sexually, Yana, who reacts primarily with facial and body gestures, eventually commits a transgressive act that poses a daunting challenge to critical judgement. The enigmatic final scene distills her despair, deception and delusions to its spiritual essence. Beginning (2020). Courtesy Mubi. Ravishingly shot by the masterful Arseni Khachaturan, Beginning catapults its director into the ranks of the finest female filmmakers, ranging from Dorothy Arzner and Lois Weber in the silent era, Chantal Akerman and Agnes Varda during the second half of the twentieth century and Lucrecia Martel and Chloe Zhao in more recent years. As an added bonus, Beginning on Mubi includes a conversation between director Luca Guadagnino and the wise-beyond-her-years Dea Kulumbegashvili, who speaks with disarming honesty about her debut. Beginning is Georgias submission for the Best International Feature Film category at the Oscars this year. For those desperately seeking excellence in cinema, the movie is essential viewing.

        Farming bills Ground report: In Haryana, farmer protests run into a caste divide Jats form the backbone of the protests. This has turned other communities away from them. Shoaib Daniyal & Vijayta Lalwani 7 hours ago Farmers protest at Delhi's Singhu border. | Adnan Abidi/Reuters No, it is not only Jats, OBCs are also a part of the movement, Manoj Kumar said, with enough force to make his tone defensive. All kisans in Haryana are involved. It has nothing to do with caste, said Kumar, a 33-year old farmer from Barota, a village in Karnal, Haryana. In September, the Modi government passed three laws to allow large corporations a much bigger role in Indian agriculture. The laws commit to making sweeping changes , which some parse as reform but others characterise as financially ruinous for the farmer. The laws have set off massive protests, with farmers mobilising around Delhi city with such force that the Modi government has built fearsome physical barriers on the capitals borders, even calling in the Border Security Force which patrols Indias borders with other countries. At first glance, Modis insistence that the laws must stay looks odd given the scale of this protest , which appears to have engulfed most of Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh. In Haryana, for instance, the internet has been suspended in many districts for the past four days. But travelling through three districts, Scroll.in found deep divisions within the state riding on the back of Indias oldest social cleavage: caste. Farmers like Manoj Kumar who belong to the predominantly agrarian, land-owning Jat community, which makes up around a quarter of the states population, form the backbone of the farmer protests in the state. But support from other castes is missing. Many non-Jats, in fact, strongly back the Modi government. They say the protestors are misled and the three protest sites on the borders of Delhi, which have grown over two months, are causing public inconvenience. Their views have grown firmer especially after the violence that erupted on Republic Day after farmers carried out a tractor parade. A few thousand from the Ghazipur protest site in Uttar Pradesh broke away and clashed with police near the Income Tax Office in central Delhi. Further ahead, some reached the Red Fort and raised flags of the Nishan Sahib, a flag sacred to the Sikhs, while clashing with the police. A stage and community kitchen set up at the Gharunda Toll Plaza en route Karnal in Haryana. (Credit: Vijayta Lalwani) Jat propulsion On the national highway, more than 120 km north of Delhi, near the Gharaunda Toll Plaza in Karnal district, a bhandara or community kitchen has been set up by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, the umbrella group of farmer unions spearheading the protests. The kitchen feeds the steady stream of farmers driving to the national capital on their tractors and trolleys from several districts of Haryana and Punjab. It has been running on support from nearby villages where Jats are dominant. Barota village in Karnal district is one of them. Farmers here collected donations from each household, pegging amounts to Rs 100 for every acre owned. So far, the village authorities have collected around Rs 2 lakh, said RS Punia, a 75-year old Jat farmer who farms on seven acres of land. Additionally, they are regularly sending rations and other supplies to the community kitchen at Gharaunda Toll Plaza. These farmers have opposed the laws for months but their dissent was revived after Bharatiya Kisan Union spokesperson Rakesh Tikaits emotional appeal on January 28 after the violence at Republic Day. Tikait was lodged at the Ghazipur protest site where the administration had ordered the eviction of the protest site by midnight. His message had an immediate impact. By midnight, several thousands of farmers from Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh rushed to the site. In Barota, the video caused a furore in the village and at least 50 farmers from Barota went to Ghazipur on January 28, said Punia. RS Punia (left) along with Randheer Singh Punia (middle) and Gyani Ram Lohan at Barota village. Credit: Vijayta Lalwani Fresh surge Further north on the highway lies Sheikhpur Khalsa village in Karnal. Joginder Phor, a 52-year-old farmer and government official from the village, drove down to the Ghazipur protest site that borders between Delhi and Uttar Pradesh on the night of January 28 after watching Tikaits video. We did not have dinner that night, said Phor, who reached the protest site before midnight. Jat farmers like Punia and Phor claim the violence at Red Fort on Republic Day was orchestrated by the Bharatiya Janata Party to derail the protests. It was their plan to make the Jats hate Sikhs but that did not happen. The farmers won, said Phor, who works in Karnals Public Works Department. Another Jat farmer from Bhigan village in Sonipat said the violence did not involve farmers. Farmers were not involved in it, said 67-year-old Kamla Garewal. They [BJP] sent people to give a bad name to farmers and so they benefit. Some questioned why the police had not yet taken action against Deep Sidhu , the actor who was present at Red Fort while clashes erupted as the Nishan Sahib, a flag sacred to the Sikhs was raised. Why has he not been arrested yet? Whose conspiracy is this? asked Gyani Ram Lohan, 84, a Jat farmer from Barota village. Kamla Garewal. A majoritarian government Others pondered over the reason why the government was adamant on not revoking the laws permanently. Punia had an answer: Bahumat ki sarkar hai. It is a majoritarian government, he said. But Lohan said that did not matter. Even if it is a government formed by the majority, it should do the right thing, he said. He questioned why Modi had not spoken about the farmers who died because of the biting winter at the capitals borders. Farmers groups claim that nearly 150 farmers have died since the protests started around Delhi. Modi says he is a phone call away, but it has been more than two monthshe is the prime minister of the country, it is his duty to ask farmers what they want, Lohan said. Since the internet suspension in a number of districts in Haryana, village residents have not been able to frequently communicate with those protesting at the borders. The absence of the internet was also a hindrance to accessing news and updates on social media especially since most protesting farmers were sceptical of the mainstream media that portrayed them as Khalistanis and terrorists. Once the net is back, I will send 1,500 replies to fake news, said Manoj Kumar, the Jat farmer from Barota village. But he added that the internet suspension would not deter farmers. Public will keep on going to the protests, he said. We have now made our own routine to go to the protest sites. Joginder Phor at the Gharunda Toll Plaza. The other side While Jats have been energised by the events of Republic Day, other castes in Haryana, however, see things in much the same way as the Modi government would want them to. In Babarpur village in Panipat district, a group of men whiling away time while playing cards argued the Modi government should have used force to stop the farmer protests after the violence on January 26. First day only they should have arrested Tikait, argued Baldev Raj, 69. Now he has been made a hero. Why wasnt he arrested if there was a case against him? Expressing vehement opposition to the protests, he said: If the police search the protestors, they will get large numbers of weapons. They arent sitting for nothing. The government needs to act. Raj is from the Khatri caste part of a substantial population of Punjabis in Haryana who descended from Partition refugees. The community are strong BJP voters in Haryana. The chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar belongs to the Khatri community. Taking the government line Rajs friend, Avinashi Lal, explained the politics of the agitation. Jats are supporting the protest since they are anti-Khattar, he said. Now for many years there will be no Jat rule. A sharp critic of the farmer agitation, Lal said: We dont support this movement. In fact, we are facing losses. Our vegetables arent reaching Delhi, people are buying less. We are having a lot of issues due to the road blockade. The Khatris of Babarpur make no bones about their support for Modi and opposition to the protests. But it is not just them this is a pattern amongst non-Jats in Haryana. Jat versus others That support for the protests breaks down along Jat and non-Jat lines is not surprising. The Bharatiya Janata Party has performed admirably since 2014 by highlighting the supposed dominance of Jats in Haryana and promising that it would act as the voice of non-Jats if it came to power. The pitch succeeded. In 2014, the BJP won a majority in the Assembly elections and installed the first non-Jat chief minister in two decades. Just two years later, the state saw widespread riots, as angry Jats sought Other Backward caste reservations, complaining that agriculture was delivering them diminishing returns. Much the same dynamic is at play here in the current protests, with Jats angry with the BJP for the new farm laws. They believe the laws will make farming even more loss making than it already is. On the other hand, many non-Jats are wary of a Jat-led protest or at least apathetic to them. Flagging support Gurmukh is a Dalit man who works with the Karnal Municipal Corportation who has little interest in the farmers agitation. Only the Jats are agitating, he claimed. We are busy with our work. Who has time to go sit in Delhi? While he was cagey about whether he supports the agitation, on the events of Republic Day, Gurmukh took a clear pro-government line: Look, we dont support or oppose the agitation but the attack on the [Indian] flag was wrong, attacking police was wrong. Property destruction was also wrong. The Indian flag was not touched during the upheaval at Red Fort on Republic Day, but pro-government TV channels spread misinformation around the act, and many non-Jats have fallen for it. Gurmukh. We were upset when the countrys flag was removed, said Aashish Tyagi, 32, a farmer in Sonepats Bhigan village. Many in the village dismiss claims that the protest has led to a new wave of Punjab-Haryana friendship two states that have often shared a tetchy relationship in the past. What bhaichara? laughed Manmohan Tyagi at claims of brotherhood. They do not even share their water with us. If you are my brother, will I not give you water from my tap, he said referring to the dispute between the two states over the relocation of water to Haryana from the Sutlej Yamuna canal. In Karnals Barota village, a saloon owner from the Brahmin community was clear that support for the protest broke down along political lines. While they use the terms farmer this agitation is actually 90% Jat, he explained. Non-Jats in Haryana silently support BJP. But they cant openly, since they arent very powerful. Jats are very powerful and very voluble in Haryana since they have land. Reflecting this silent opposition, the saloon owner asked to not be named: Many people are angry with the agitation but they cant speak openly. Support our journalism by subscribing to Scroll+ .

        Pearl Continental Hotel in Gwadar, Balochistan. The hotel came under attack as some armed militants on Saturday stormed its premises on Saturday evening. (Photo: ANI) Three heavily-armed militants on Saturday stormed a luxury hotel in Pakistans port city of Gwadar in the restive Balochistan province, leading to a fierce gunbattle in which four persons including the attackers were killed, police said. The armed men entered the upscale Pearl Continental (PC) Hotel and opened random firing, a senior police official said. They shot dead a guard at the entrance, the armys media wing Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said. https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png A shootout between the militants and the security forces broke out at the hotel as the anti-terrorism force, the Army and the Frontier Corps were called in, Gwadar Station House Officer (SHO) Aslam Bangulzai said. Balochistan Home Minister Ziaullah Langov said that all the three attackers were killed by the security forces. He said that some of the guests in the hotel were also injured but their number was not immediately known. The outlawed Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility of the attack which it said was carried out by the militants linked with its Majeed Brigade group. Locals said several gunshots were heard after the terrorists entered the luxury hotel. Gwadar port is one of the focal points of the USD 50 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) with many Chinese workers from other provinces of Pakistan working at the port. The hotel, frequented by business as well as leisure travellers, is located on the Koh-e-Batil hill, south of West Bay on Fish Harbour road in Gwadar. All foreign and local guests staying at the hotel had been safely evacuated, Express Tribune quoted Balochistan Information Minister Zahoor Buledi as saying. At around 4:50 pm (local time) we got reports that there are two to there armed men in PC Hotel, SHO Bangulzai said. Two to three gunmen had first fired at and then entered the hotel, Inspector General of Police (IGP) Mohsin Hassan Butt said. A clearance operation was going on, a spokesman of the army said. The provincial police chief further said that the attackers may have come in a boat to launch the attack. Balochistan Chief Minister Jam Kamal Khan Alyani condemned the terrorists attack on PC Hotel, and instructed the authorities to ensure the safety of all inside the hotel, Dawn news reported. He called for a well planned and strong action against the terrorists, adding that he is in touch with police and local administration regarding the situation. Balochistan, which borders Afghanistan and Iran, is Pakistans largest and poorest province, rife with ethnic, sectarian and separatist insurgencies. On April 18, unidentified gunmen donning uniforms of paramilitary soldiers massacred at least 14 passengers, including Pakistan Navy personnel, after forcing them to disembark from buses on a highway in Balochistan. China is investing heavily in Balochistan under the CPEC. The CPEC, launched in 2015, is a planned network of roads, railways and energy projects linking Chinas resource-rich Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region with Pakistans strategic Gwadar Port on the Arabian Sea. The BLA is one of the most-organised terrorist group of Baloch nationalists fighting against security forces.

Aadhaar number or at least documents to prove that one has enrolled for the 12-digit unique identity number will be mandatory to seek treatment under the scheme for the second time. To avail benefits for the first time, one can either show an Aadhaar or any other identity document like election card etc, Bhushan said. The Ayushman Bharat-National Health Protection Mission (AB-NHPM), which was renamed as AB-PMJAY, was launched pan-India by the prime minister from Jharkhand on September 23. Since its rollout, over 50,000 poor people have availed benefits of the scheme, which has been touted as the worlds largest health insurance programme, Union Health Minister J P Nadda said. He said Prime Minister Narendra Modis idea of providing free health services has given strength to these families. Over 92,000 people have been given Gold cards, Deputy CEO of NHA, Dinesh Arora said. Under the scheme, the government aims at providing a coverage of Rs 5 lakh per family annually, benefiting more than 10.74 crore poor families for secondary and tertiary care hospitalisation through a network of Empanelled Health Care Providers (EHCP). The PMJAY will provide cashless and paperless access to services for the beneficiary at the point of service. The scheme will target poor, deprived rural families and has identified occupational category of urban workers families, 8.03 crore in rural and 2.33 crore in urban areas, as per the latest Socio-Economic Caste Census (SECC) data. It will cover around 50 crore people and there is no cap on family size and age in the scheme ensuring that nobody is left out. Arora further said that 98 per cent of beneficiaries have already been identified. Over 14,000 hospitals both public and private, have been empanelled for the scheme, and as many as 32 states and union territories have signed MoUs with the Centre and will implement the programme.

        BJP MP Shobha Karandlaje on Saturday challenged the Karnataka government to arrest her for alleged inflammatory tweets on the rape and murder of a minor Dalit girl in Vijayapura. If Siddaramaiahs government has courage, let it arrest me. I am not applying for bail. Whatever I have tweeted is based on what I have seen and heard in media, she told reporters in Bengaluru. I will put my case before the police. Let them interrogate me, she said, a day after she was booked for the alleged inflammatory tweets. Inspite of informing the police about the incident, the government did not arrest the culprits and instead booked a case against her, Karandlaje said. She alleged that the FIR against her was politically motivated. Police had alleged Karandlajes tweets added to tension in the regions of coastal Karnataka, which was on the boil since December 6 when 19-year-old Paresh Mesta was found dead under mysterious circumstances. An FIR was filed against Karandlaje on charges of provoking people to cause riots, disturbing communal harmony and spreading rumours. CM @siddaramaiahs appeasement politics has turned Karnataka into a safe haven for Jihadi Goons. He is shamelessly pursuing his agenda of appeasement & dividing the society, Karandlaje had tweeted.

        ANGRY AT being videographed for using cell phone while driving a motorcycle, Head Constable Surinder Singh of Chandigarh Police slapped the man, who made a video clip, at the dividing road of sectors 24 and 36 on Friday.On Saturday, when Sumit Kumar Tiwari (29), who was slapped by the head constable, uploaded the clip on social networking sites, it triggered anguish among netizens and was subsequently shared by several people, including Congress leader Manish Tewari. As a result, Surinder was suspended, challaned for using cell phone while driving and not wearing safety gear and his driving licence was suspended for six months. Also, a departmental probe has been ordered against Surinder, posted at police headquarters, Sector 9. Sumit, a resident of Kansal and an employee of an event management company, said, I was coming from Sector 9 when I saw the policeman riding a motorcycle and also using his cell phone. He had fixed his cell phone in his helmet. Even two traffic policemen, standing at the light point of Sector 25, overlooked this. I filmed him on my cell phone and when I went to tell him that it is wrong, the policeman slapped me. I ran away fearing that he would implicate me in a false case. Sumit added, When I narrated my experience to my friends, they advised me to upload the clip on social networking sites, including that of Chandigarh traffic police. I did and soon, a traffic police team came and recorded my statement. Minutes later, I learnt that the policeman was suspended and challaned for his offence. Congress leader Manish Tewari tagged Chandigarh Police DGP Tajender Singh Luthra on his Twitter account, carrying the video clip demanding strict action against the policeman. Police sources said a traffic police team contacted Surinder on phone, traced his location and took away his driving licence.  The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

        Early in my acting career I would've loved to play the roles performed by Daniel Day Lewis (such as My Left Foot, Gangs of New York and There Will be Blood). But over the years, I began to admire Lewis's performance in My Left Foot. The physical pain and emotional suppression of a gifted Irish painter who uses his left foot to communicate his art is a role worth dying for. This is an ultimate character for any actor as it entails a physicality, which is unusual and unique.

        To bring in more automation and efficacy in the functioning of the state Public Relations department, Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Wednesday virtually launched a mobile application DigiNest, to give people digital access to the state governments directory, which can be synced with the smart phone with the click of a button. The Chief Minister also rolled out an online Punjab Advertisement Release Order System to bring transparency and efficiency in the entire process of releasing State Governments advertisements and payments to media houses. The system, he said, would help streamline the process of issuance of advertisements and release of payments. The two initiatives, said the Chief Minister, would be instrumental in creating synergy between the PR department and the stakeholders concerned, especially the common people. Coming on the heels of the recently launched `PR Insight, they would further help the Information and Public Relations Department, which is the brains behind `DigiNest to achieve new heights in the sphere of digitalization, he added. It may be recalled that the Chief Minister had recently launched Mobile Application and web portal PR Insight to monitor the feedback, and subsequently improve the delivery of citizen centric services to ensure responsive and transparent administration in the State. DigiNest will enable citizens to check department-wise contact numbers of various officers, and help them reach out with ease to the officers by calling or sending E-mail. The employees of Punjab Government can also log into the app using their HRMS credentials and can keep themselves updated about superannuation and birthday dates of their fellow employees in order to send greetings via SMS or WhatsApp. Transfer orders of officers can also be accessed from DigiNest, which the state government is planning to make the official App for release of such orders. The holiday calendar of Punjab Government with details of all the Gazetted Holidays, Restricted Holidays and Week-off days can also be accessed. An added feature of the calendar is listing of dates on which Sangraand, Pooranmashi, Masseya fall every month. Further, the News section of the app would also enable people to access the news through digital mode, apart from searching the news district wise or by using keywords. The option of taking notes by typing in the app or by using a stylus has also been provided. Apart from these, the Magazine Section of the app provides digital access to the monthly magazine Punjab Advance and Progressive Farming published by Department of Information and Public Relations and Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana respectively. The online release order system would put an end to the manual process of submission of advertisement requests/indents, as well as manual bill submissions, by client organizations The novel initiative would save time and bring transparency, besides ensuring real time tracking of Release Order by various departments & the DIPR. The online billing process would be beneficial for the departmental officials and news agencies to know the status of bills, Standardization of formats across departments and news agencies and better reporting system and audit process. The Punjab Advertisement Release Order System has been developed by NIC Punjab after detailed study and Government Process Re-engineering of the end-to-end process.

        The Uttarakhand High Court has sought a reply from the State Government regarding non-compliance to its earlier order on restoring Adi Shankaracharyas Samadhi at Kedarnath following the 2013 disaster. In the past, the High Court had directed that the Samadhi be restored within a year but the same has not been done yet. Expressing its displeasure at this, the division Bench of acting Chief Justice Ravikumar Malimath and Justice Manoj Kumar Tiwari asked why should a contempt notice not be issued to the departments concerned, while directing the State Government to submit its explanation and reply in the court within two weeks. The case will be taken up for hearing next on January 14. It is pertinent to mention here that Delhi resident Ajay Gautam had filed a public interest litigation regarding the restoration of the Samadhi of Adi Shankaracharya near the Kedarnath shrine from where it was swept away during the 2013 disaster. In its order in October 2018, the high court had directed that the Samadhi be restored within a period of one year but this task has not been done so far. Stating that this is contempt of the High Court order, the petitioner has stated that Adi Shankaracharya had established the Char Dham pilgrimage to shrines across India including to Badrinath in Uttarakhand. It was Shankaracharya who had made the Uttarakhand region popular around the world, despite which the state government has not done the needful for his Samadhi. This is despite the fact that the Kedarnath reconstruction project is a dream project of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the petitioner added.

        The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and MLA, Raghav Chadha on Wednesday visited the Singhu border to ensure proper installation and functioning of five free WiFi hotspots on the border for protesting farmers. Chadha had yesterday announced that Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal will begin another 'sewa' for farmers at the Singhu border. The decision was made after several farmers had complained about poor connectivity and a bad network at the Singhu border. We had received complaints from several farmers that due to poor connectivity and reception at Singhu border, they were unable to stay connected with their families, they were unable to make video calls. Sewaadar Arvind KejriwalJi decided to do something about this, which is why as promised yesterday, weve begun the installation of free WiFi hotspots, said Raghav Chadha. Chadha also said that based on feedback from farmers with respect to places at Singhu with poor reception, some WiFi hotspot areas had been shortlisted. We would also like to tell our farmer brothers that similar Wifi will be installed at Tikri border. Better connectivity will enable the farmers' access to social media to give a befitting answer to BJP leaders whove been spreading fake news about them. In addition, they will be able to make as many video calls with their loved ones as they want, said Chadha. Talking about how the farmer movement is growing stronger by the day with farmers from across the country marching towards Delhi, Chadha said, One can gauge the importance, the relevance of this movement from the fact that farmers from different parts of India are marching towards Delhi to fight for their rights, said Chadha. This is a historic movement, and as you know, several farmer brothers have been living away from the warmth of their homes and their families for a long time. Their families will be concerned about them. Their friends would want to speak with them. They in turn would be eager to see the faces of their parents, spouses, and children. By installing free WiFi hotspots here at the Singhu border, we hope that despite the distance, our farmer brothers may feel a little closer home, said Raghav Chadha.

The Government would bear interest subvention for five years, including one-year moratorium against the loan availed by project proponents from banks, at the rate of 6 per cent per annum or 50 per cent of the rate of interest charged by banks, whichever is lower. The interest subvention would be available for setting up new as well as an expansion of existing molasses or grain-based distilleries and for units that will produce ethanol from other feedstocks such as sugar beet, sweet sorghum and cereals. Previously, Rs 4,687 crore interest subvention scheme was approved and now Rs 4,573 crore has been sanctioned, said Pradhan.

        Hearing on a public interest litigation filed against acquisition of 1,072 acres land of GB Pant University of Agriculture and Technology for construction of an airport in Pantnagar, the Uttarakhand High Court has directed the State and Central Governments, the university and Civil Aviation Ministry to submit their reply within two weeks. The division Bench of acting Chief Justice Ravikumar Malimath and Justice Alok Kumar Verma has set January 13 as the next date of hearing for the case. In his PIL, social worker residing in Udham Singh Nagar, Keshav Pasi has stated that a new airport is proposed to be constructed on the southern side of the GB Pant University of Agriculture and Technology for which about 1,072 acres land of the university is being acquired. The petitioner has further stated that since the creation of Uttarakhand till the present, about 4,300 acres land of the university has been acquired for non-agricultural works. This is posing a threat to the very existence of the university credited with a crucial role in the green revolution. Presently, there is already an airport on the northern side and with SIIDCUL industrial estate on side of the university another airport is proposed on the southern side. This will generate noise and pollution all around the university which will affect the academic atmosphere and research work here. The petitioner has further stated that the university provides 25 per cent of the nations total seed requirement. Further, in a survey, the revenue council had acknowledged that there is about 76,842 acres of barren land in Nainital and Udham Singh Nagar. Instead of diverting fertile land for construction of an airport, the barren land should be used for this purpose. Apart from this, the place where the new airport is proposed to be constructed has 11 canals around it and the land is also swampy and not suitable for an airport, the petitioner has stated.

        new delhi : CBSE has introduced changes in examination bylaws to include all kinds of disabilities mentioned in the Disability Act 1995 for Board exams 2009. For instance, apart from dyslexic, visually and hearing impaired and spastic students, those with autism will also get special facilities from the Board. Moreover, amanuensis (writers) will be provided to students with special needs free of cost from this year. "We have amended our examination bylaws. Now any student with any disability covered under the Persons with Disabilities Act can get special facilities to appear in the Boards. The schools just have to seek exemption for such children with the related medical certificates to establish the disability,'' said Rama Sharma, spokesperson, CBSE. Sharma added that CBSE provides a host of facilities for differently-abled children like setting up of special centres for them, allowing them to study only one language, making them sit on the ground floor and giving them extra time. For visually impaired students, alternative questions are given in place of map work or diagrams and question papers with enlarged print are provided for Maths and Science for these students in Class X. Blind candidates in the city can opt for a computer or a typewriter to write their answers. Also, students with visual impairment and dyslexia specially make use of scribes to write their papers. "Students using the services of a scribe had to pay Rs 100 as fee to the Board till last year, however, it has been waived off now,'' said Madhulika Sen, principal, Tagore International School, Vasant Vihar from where five visually impaired students from Class X and three from Class XII will take the Board exams this year. The scribes are generally provided by the school, who are one class lower than the candidate. According to Sameera Panigrahi, a special educator at Shri Ram School, a scribe plays an important role for dyslexic students. "Children with dyslexia have high IQ but they have a problem with spellings and putting their thoughts on paper. That's where a scribe comes in,'' she said. Special facilities to meet special needs * Extra time of 60 minutes on a three-hour paper, 50 minutes on a two-and-a-half-hours paper, 40 minutes for a two-hour paper and 30 minutes for a one-and-a-half hour paper * Question papers in large print for students with visual impairment * Free-of-cost scribe to write the paper

        this story is from October 25, 2018 IIT Madras disappointed over not granted Institutes of Eminence status; writes to HRD ministry PTI | Oct 25, 2018, 08:40 IST While the ministry will grant Rs 1,000 crore funds to the three public institutions in the next five years, the private institutes will not be eligible for government funding. NEW DELHI: The Indian Institute of Technology-Madras has written to Union HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar expressing disappointment over not figuring in the list of Institutes of Eminence (IoE) despite a recommendation from the UGC-mandated selection panel. According to sources, the premier institution has argued that it matched the calibre of the selected institutions on various parameters and it being ignored in the IoE race had impacted the morale of students and teachers. The Human Resource Development (HRD) Ministry had in July granted 'Institutions of Eminence' status to three public and private institutes each, enabling them to get full autonomy and special incentives to project them as "world class universities". While the ministry will grant Rs 1,000 crore funds to the three public institutions in the next five years, the private institutes will not be eligible for government funding. The government granted IoE status to IIT-Delhi, IIT-Bombay and Bengaluru-based Indian Institute of Science (IISc) in the public sector; and Manipal Academy of Higher Education, BITS Pilani and Jio Institute by Reliance Foundation in the private sector. The selection of yet-to-be established Jio institute had invited criticism from various quarters which alleged that the government was favouring certain corporates. The ministry later clarified that the IoE tag to the Jio institute was conditional.

        JAIPUR: Samples of nine out of the 11 UK-returnees from Rajasthan tested negative for the mutated strain. Their samples were sent to the National Institute of Virology, Pune. The reports of two samples are awaited. Three more samples have been collected from UK returnees in Sriganganagar for testing the new strain. They have been found infected with Covid. Following detection of the new Covid strain in the UK, all collectors have been directed to increase viral genomic surveillance in order to understand the spread of the virus in a rapid and robust manner. Samples will be collected from infected people and will be tested on a regular basis for the new strain and variant. The state had sent five samples from Udaipur, three from Bhilwara and one each from Jaipur, Ajmer and Jalore. The report of samples sent from Ajmer and Jalore is awaited, while rest of the nine reports have been received, said a senior health department official. In Bhilwara, three samples were sent of those people who were in contact of the UK-returned people. They were found infected with Covid and all of them have tested negative for the UKs mutated strain, said the official. From now on, the state government will send samples to CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB, Delhi) to ascertain the current status of new variant of SARS-CoV-2 and to establish a sentinel surveillance for early detection of genomic variants with public health implication and to determine the genomic variant in the unusual events or trends such as super-spreader events, high mortality or morbidity trend areas. We have sent the samples collected from the UK-returned people who were found infected with the virus in Sriganganagar and sent them to Delhi for testing the strain, said the official. The Centre has written to the states that in order to fully understand the spread and evolution of the SARS CoV-2 virus, and to tackle its future spread, sequencing and analyzing the genomic data of the novel corona virus would be required. The study of accumulated of mutations in the viral genomes will enable the Centre to compare virus samples and viral lineages in order to understand if local outbreaks are caused by transmission of single or multiple lineages.

Help us delete comments that do not follow these guidelines by marking them offensive. Let's work together to keep the conversation civil. Now Reading: We live in a fast-paced world, where change is constant. In a world where we don't have time for each other at all, finding people who truly love you is indeed rare. Aim to never let them go. Intimacy, communication and most importantly, spending time with each other is an essential part of a healthy relationship. So, we bring to you common ways to make time for intimacy with your loved ones, based on your zodiac sign.  Making time for love doesnt have to be done in a profligate or expensive way, but it should simply be thoughtful and contemplative. Make time for love by being spontaneous and adventurous. Spending quality time together will really help you to bring your partner closer to you. Go on adventurous trips, explore new places whenever you find time for each other.  Making time for love should be as simple as doing something you already do every day. Make dinner, do the laundry, or put away the dishes together. These actions will mean a lot if you give it your all. Give yourselves time to talk and reunite with one another and make it a goal to regularly do things together.  Communication is the key to a successful relationship. Even if you and your partner are busy during the day, try texting each other. Send good morning messages as it makes your partner feel special and cared for. The point is, being able to share something, even when youre not with each other, is a great way to make time for love, no matter what. Cancerians are sensitive and the best at making someone feel special. It is one of your strengths, so why not use it as a perk and make your partner feel wanted always? You can simply get something for your partner that they love, it'll definitely bring a smile to their face and build your bond stronger. As a Leo, you need a lot of passion and fire in your relationship. Its certainly a good thing that youre so vocal and open about your needs because its certainly better than being quiet and hoping your partners notices you need something. Even the smallest expressions of love are important, saying I love you, can help your relationship grow. If you want to make time for love, all you have to do is use your love language. As a Virgo, you have a very giving and loving nature. So try surprising your partner with gifts, roses and chocolates, it's a great option! You can also go for occasional candlelight dinner dates. Romance is very important to you, but being with your partner all the time and spending time is not possible as you just don't have time for that kind of expression of love, always. If you want to make time for your partner, you need to get rid of the preconceived notion that love can only exist when its over-the-top and spontaneous. Learn to love the comfortable vibe that comes with love. Being in love is very important to you, but in reality, being in it can seem very scary. You dont share your heart with just anyone, but when you do find someone you truly care about and love, you make a serious effort. Make time for love by opening up, that might mean sharing a personal anecdote or just being honest about your feelings for them. One of your biggest fears is losing your freedom and yourself in a relationship. Even if this doesnt actually happen, you are always scared about the same. If you want to make time for love, plan a day when you can learn something new from your partner. Sharing your hobbies and teaching each other little things is a surefire way to bond with each other. Learn something new, and fall in love just a little bit more. Find out about the latest Lifestyle, Fashion & Beauty trends, Relationship tips & the buzz on Health & Food. Thanks for subscribing.

Just drop in a mail at toiblogs@timesinternet.in with a brief bio and we will get in touch with you. The writer is founder-president, CanSupport The fight against cancer is beginning to show results in a few countries. But it is not yet time to celebrate. According to the American Cancer Society, the death rate from cancer in the US for the year 2017-18 dropped by 2.4%. This is the biggest decline, in a single year, on record. It is the fall in mortality rates of difficult cancers like lung cancer, in both males and females, that is inviting attention. The question is: what is responsible for this decline? Is it because people are smoking less? Is it because their cancers are being detected early? Or is it because we have better treatments today? Common sense suggests the answer lies in a mix of all three, though there are those who attribute it mainly to the implementation of effective tobacco control strategies in the US that saw a decline in the rates of smoking from 20.9% in 2005 to 15.1% in 2015. However, even here there is little room for complacency. First, a substantial proportion of beginning smokers and most new daily smokers are now young adults, reflecting a shift from adolescence to early adulthood. The proportion of young adult smokers (ages 18-23 years) more than doubled from 20.6% in 2002 to 42.6% in 2018. What this means is that tobacco control strategies aimed at adolescents in high school (age 15 years or so) are merely delaying or deferring initiation of smoking rather than preventing it. This is a worry. Next, there is the additional concern that since the pandemic, missed detection opportunities may result in patients being diagnosed with more advanced and harder-to-treat stages of cancer in the future. A Lancet study estimates that there may be an increase in cancer deaths as a result of diagnostic delays over the next five years, ranging from 4.8% for lung cancer to 16.6% for colorectal cancer. With detection services shut down, and with delayed treatments for cancer, especially in the early months of the pandemic, it is likely that we are going to meet the same fate here in India. Our cancer mortality registration system has many shortcomings, including incomplete and inaccurate certification of cause of death. This makes it difficult to draw any reliable or firm conclusions about the trend in cancer mortality rates. The time has come for the government to declare cancer a notifiable disease so that data collection can improve and we can assess where we are headed. Future planning and the lives of people depend on this. What we also know is that underserved populations everywhere are at greater risk of dying of diseases like cancer due to limited access to detection facilities and to advances in cancer treatment that they simply cannot afford. Consequently, they are more likely to die of cancer. The novel coronavirus just brought this lesson home to us as well. So, let us add to the mix mentioned above what may indeed be the decisive factor for ensuring good outcomes for people living with cancer, universal health care with access to high quality and affordable cancer care backed by a robust public health system. Tele-medicine has a role to play here. The setting up of a national cancer grid to bridge the divide between users and providers of high quality cancer care is a step in the right direction. I recall listening a few years ago to Lance Armstrong talk about his cancer experience and what had led him to start the Livestrong Foundation. It was a remark made by his doctor who asked him which exit he would use once he left the hospital after successful treatment. Would it be the one that would keep his cancer secret (Lance had testicular cancer which carried a stigma, particularly in Texas where he lived)? Or the one where, fortunate enough to have been able to afford the best cancer treatments, he would now consider it his obligation to use his celebrity status to ensure that others too got a second chance? Despite his subsequent fall from grace, it is to be noted that Lance helped raise over $500 million for cancer research, treatment and support, including $6.5 million he donated personally. India has a number of cancer support organisations working heroically to help raise awareness about cancer and offering much needed services free of charge. However, without affordable and accessible cancer treatments to back these efforts they seem almost unethical. As someone once said to me after being detected with a malignant tumour, You have put my house on fire but have given me no means of putting out the fire. What is true for a slum dweller is as true for middle class patients. While the former can now draw funds from various government schemes by showing their BPL cards the latter are left to fend for themselves. These are the patients and families we often meet; tired, dispirited and defeated by a disease that has become an unbearable burden. The only way to ensure that cancer mortality rates in our country fall is to start from the beginning. If I know that a diagnosis of cancer will not ruin me financially and that I will get the best treatment available I will come in for cancer screening. Otherwise, why would I voluntarily go forward to meet a disease that will destroy me? 46 minutes ago Even if you get detected at right time doctors lead you astray and it ends up amplifying and a moment comes when you can no longer afford the treatment. Government has to take responsibility for each life and health of every citizen. Charitable Foundations are just for kids and old people. Where would young or middle-aged ones go?...

        President Trump to hold White House COVID-19 summit as pressure mounts for FDA vaccine approval WASHINGTON President Donald Trump is set tokick off a summitat the White House on Tuesday to highlight the rapiddevelopment ofa COVID-19 vaccine he is eager to take credit for despite criticism for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. The summit, designed to provide an update on the status of the administration's ambitious planto vaccinate all Americans against the coronavirus, comes two days before the FDAadvisory committee will meet to review Pfizer and BioNTech'sapplication for emergency authorization of theirCOVID-19 vaccine and distribution is expected to begin within 24 hours of authorization. The FDA will also meet on Dec. 17 to review Moderna's emergency request for its vaccine. The FDA released a comprehensive report Tuesday supporting earlier findings that Pfizer's vaccine candidate is safe and will prevent 95% of people from becoming sick with COVID-19. Trump has repeatedly creditedOperation Warp Speed, his administration'spublic-private coronavirus response initiative,for the record development of vaccinesbut has not acknowledged a deadly surge in COVID-19 cases that's led to more than 282,000 deaths in the U.S. Tuesday'sevent will be split into sessions and is expected to include drug manufacturers, transportation companies like UPS and FedEx, drug store chains CVS and Walgreens, and a group of state governors. Moderna and Pfizer, the two U.S. companies behind the vaccine candidates,told USA TODAY that officials will not attend the summit. The White House was initially in talks to include both drugmakers but determined their participation was not required after the decision to include Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation. "It was more appropriate not to have one or more vaccine companies with pending applications before the FDA also participating," a senior administration official said on a briefing call with reporters Tuesday evening. Trump also plans to sign an executive order designed to ensure that all Americans have access to vaccines before the U.S. government begins aiding other nations with their inoculation efforts. It was not immediately clear how Trump would enforce the directive. The order comes after administration officials reportedly passed on buying additional doses of Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine, according to a New York Times report. As the global race for a vaccine heats up, the U.S. may not be able to buy additional doses of Pfizer's vaccine until June because ofthe drugmaker's commitments to other countries, the newspaper reported. Senior administration officials told reporters Tuesday the story was "false," adding that they couldn't comment publicly on ongoing negotiations to purchase additional doses. "We feel absolutely confident that we will get the vaccine doses, for which we've contracted, and we'll have sufficient number of doses to vaccinate all Americans who desire one before the end of the second quarter2021," a senior administration official said. Pressure is mounting for the FDA to move faster on approving the emergency use of the two vaccines from Pfizer and BioNTech and Moderna before Trump leaves office on Jan. 20. The president has even suggested without proof that Pfizer intentionally withheldclinical trial data showing itssuccess until after the election to undercut his chances at a second term. Albert Bourla, Pfizer's CEO, toldAxios that he would've released the results before Election Day on Nov. 3, had he been able to. Thedata came two or three days after Election Day, andas a result, he said, the soonest the independent monitoring committee could analyze the datawas Nov. 8, after Biden had been declared president-elect. FACT CHECK: Pfizer received COVID-19 vaccine data after Election Day, released within days WHAT WE KNOW: There are now three promising COVID vaccine candidates. FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn was summoned to the White House last week to brief White House chief of staff Mark Meadows on the status of the federal agency's review of the vaccine candidates after the U.K. became the first country to authorize Pfizer's candidate vaccine for emergency use. About 50 hospitals in the United Kingdom will receive the first batch of the coronavirus vaccine created by American drugmaker Pfizer and Germany's BioNTech beginning on Tuesday, according tothe BBC . Hahn told Reuters he understood the pressure his federal agency is under from the president, the administration and others but said he had a "robust discussion" with Meadows about the FDA process and ensuring the vaccine is "safe and effective."He also said he was "hopeful" that the FDA could authorize a vaccine in December and the advisory committee expects "to move very quickly" on approval. Senior administration officials told reporters they expect about 6 million doses available in the first week of authorization of emergency use of a vaccine. Officials said they expect 20 million people vaccinated and40 million doses available in the month of December. Every dose has been paid for by the federal government and there will be no co-pays, deductibles or co-insuranceassociated with vaccinations, senior administration officials said. The government plans to reimburse vaccination sites up to $12 billion over the next six to seven months to help cover the cost. The president will open the event by delivering remarks and signing the executive order ensuring American vaccine priority, senior administration officials said. Vice President Mike Pence, who leadsthe White House COVID-19task force, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Adm. Brett Giroir, the administration's COVID-19 testing czar, are also slated to speak. CVS and Walgreens plan to discuss their mobile vaccination service designed to vaccinate people in every nursing home and long-term care facility in the country. Governorsare developing their own micro-plans for vaccine distribution within their states, administration officials said.Three of the four governors invited to the summit are Republicans: Ron DeSantis of Florida, Bill Lee of Tennessee, and Greg Abbot of Texas. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana, a Democrat, is also on the guest list. No one from President-elect Joe Biden's transition team was invited to the summit, even though the Biden administration will oversee the distribution program after it takes office next month. More: When might a COVID-19 vaccine be authorized? FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn answers common questions One goal of the summit is to persuade people that vaccines are safe, aides said. To that end, they added, one session of the summit will be devoted to how the Food and Drug Administration is evaluating the vaccines. Administration officials also are expectedto clarify the priority lists for receipt of vaccines that is, which groups get it first, and why. Contributing: Karen Weintraub

        Critically endangered North Atlantic right whale population gets a boost: 2 newborns spotted off US coast Biologists from theClearwater Marine Aquarium in Florida knew immediately what they were seeing: It was a North Atlantic right whale calf. They couldn't help but be ecstatic. "Soon enough, the team knew the mother would surface for a breath of air and the calving season would have the first live mother-calf right whale pair, said Melanie White, a research biologist who serves as the aquarium's North Atlantic Right Whale Conservation Project Manager. The calf,found swimming on Dec. 4 with a first-time momknown as Chiminea off the coast ofCumberland Island in Georgia, was the first of two live calves found over the past week, theNational Marine Fisheries Servicetweeted Monday. The second, bornto 16 year-old Millepede,was spotted Monday while swimming with bottlenose dolphinsoff Vilano Beach in Florida. Uplifting news for this fragile species especially during the first week of December," White said. And especially upliftingafter adead North Atlantic right whale calf washed ashore last month in North Carolina. A preliminary necropsy suggested the calf died during or shortly after birth and no humans were involved in the death, according to a statement from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. These births represent a bright light in an otherwise dismal situation, said Jane Davenport, senior attorney at Defenders of Wildlife, a nonprofit conservation organization. Davenport also noted that while these new births deserve celebration, they amount to little if we dont prevent the vessel strikes and gear entanglements that have reduced the population by 25% in less than a decade." Right whales got their name from being the right whale to hunt because they swim slowly, stay close to shore and float when dead. They were hunted nearly to extinction but began a gradual comeback after hunting them was outlawed. In recent years, however, their slow population growth reversed. The waters off Georgia and Florida are the whales only known calving grounds. Pregnant females go there in winter from the feeding grounds off New England and Canada to give birth. During the 2019-20 calving season, there were 10 calves born, up from seven in 2018-19.But researchers say about 20 births a year are needed to ensure the species' survival. There are about 360 North Atlantic right whales left in the world, due to fishing equipment entanglement, whaling, vessel strikes, and ocean noise levels, according to NMFS (also known as NOAA Fisheries). Conditions are so dire for the endangered sea mammal that more than 55 conservation organizations sent a letter to Congress on Dec. 3 seekingemergency action. "If Congress continues to underfund right whale recovery, there is a very real prospect of the species going extinct in the next decade or two," the letter says."The small funding increases that Congress has provided in past appropriations bills, while appreciated, are wholly insufficient to save the right whale from slipping further towards extinction, let alone putting it on the path to recovery."

They would become the first team since the Los Angeles Galaxy in 2010-11 to win back-to-back titles. The Crew and the Sounders havent played since the final game before MLS shut down due to the coronavirus pandemic, way back on March 7. Gyasi Zardes scored a first-half goal andRuidiazscored a penalty kick in the second half of a thrilling 1-1 draw that felt like a potential preview of a league final. Though the Sounders are the No. 2 seed in the West and the Crew is the No. 3 seed in the East, the Crew (1.78) finished with a higher points per game than the Sounders (1.77) during the regular season, giving the Crew home-field advantage for the final. The Sounders went down 2-0 in the 67thminute, but a team with playoff experience to spare found a way to advance to the clubs fourth MLS Cup in five seasons.

        Bob Woodward to take on final days of Trumps presidency in next book The Associated Press NEW YORK (AP) Bob Woodwards next book finds him in the familiar world of documenting a presidencys ending. Woodward is teaming with Washington Post colleague Robert Costa on a book about the waning days of Donald Trumps administration and on the initial phase of Joe Bidens presidency. The book does not yet have a title or release date. In 1976, Woodward and then-fellow Washington Post reporter Carl Bernstein collaborated on the best-selling The Final Days, what was then an unusually detailed and devastating account of President Richard Nixon as he neared being forced out of office over the Watergate scandal the reporters helped break. Woodward already has written two best-sellers on Trump, Fear and Rage . For the new book, Woodward and Costa will have competition, from other Post reporters. Penguin Press announced Monday that Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig, co-authors of the Trump book A Very Stable Genius, are writing about his last year in office and his loss to Biden. There is currently no title or release date. More: Bob Woodward's Donald Trump book 'Rage' sells 600,000 copies in first week More: Donald Trump books will continue after the president leaves office
