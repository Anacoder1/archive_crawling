Take small breaks. This will help you in concentrating effectively.While making notes, don\u2019t make long sentences. Keep them short. This way, you would be able to memorise them fast. Use abbreviations while making notes.JEE Main examines your basics. Keep your basics strong. Solving complex problems requires you to have strong fundamentals. Do not skip a topic because it seems hard. Read it as many times as required.Cover every part of NCERT thoroughly. Most of the questions asked in the exam can be found in NCERT.Don\u2019t neglect eleventh class topics. Keep revising them with the same intensity as twelfth class topics.Coaching classes and school classes will help in studying the topics. But self-study holds the ultimate power. Always remember, nothing can replace self-study. Having a complete grasp of topics is only possible through self-study.Invest your break time into something productive such as music, art, or any sports activities. This will increase your productivity and concentration.Take tests regularly. Your test scores will work as a constant reminder for your target score.Maintain test logs. These logs not only help you supervise your scores but also point out the areas you need to work on.Revise the questions from your test logs every time before appearing for the next practice test.Take proper sleep of seven to eight hours. Compromising with sleep will result in lack of concentration and will affect your retaining power.Stay healthy. Health is important in times of preparation. Stay hydrated and take nutritious food. Don\u2019t take the stress.","inLanguage":"en","articleSection":"education","url":"https://www.ndtv.com/education/jee-main-2021-know-preparation-tips-salient-topics-and-weightage","image":"https://www.ndtv.com/education/cache-static/media/article_images/2020/11/2/gate-changes.jpg","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Gargi Tomar"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"NDTV","url":"https://www.ndtv.com","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.ndtv.com/static/ndtv_2014/images/ndtvlogo_blk.png","width":250,"height":60}},"datePublished":"2020-11-02T15:40:45.549838+05:30","dateModified":"2020-11-02T15:40:45.590918+05:30"}</script>

                        <h2><strong>Important preparation tips for JEE Main:</strong></h2><ul><li>Divide you study time into small portions of one to two hours each. Take small breaks. This will help you in concentrating effectively.</li><li>While making notes, don’t make long sentences. Keep them short. This way, you would be able to memorise them fast. Use abbreviations while making notes.</li><li>JEE Main examines your basics. Keep your basics strong. Solving complex problems requires you to have strong fundamentals. Do not skip a topic because it seems hard. Read it as many times as required.</li><li>Cover every part of NCERT thoroughly. Most of the questions asked in the exam can be found in NCERT.</li><li>Don’t neglect eleventh class topics. Keep revising them with the same intensity as twelfth class topics.</li><li>Coaching classes and school classes will help in studying the topics. But self-study holds the ultimate power. Always remember, nothing can replace self-study. Having a complete grasp of topics is only possible through self-study.</li><li>Invest your break time into something productive such as music, art, or any sports activities. This will increase your productivity and concentration.</li><li>Take tests regularly. Your test scores will work as a constant reminder for your target score.</li><li>Maintain test logs. These logs not only help you supervise your scores but also point out the areas you need to work on.</li><li>Revise the questions from your test logs every time before appearing for the next practice test.</li><li>Take proper sleep of seven to eight hours. Compromising with sleep will result in lack of concentration and will affect your retaining power.</li><li>Stay healthy. Health is important in times of preparation. Stay hydrated and take nutritious food. Don’t take the stress.</li></ul>
