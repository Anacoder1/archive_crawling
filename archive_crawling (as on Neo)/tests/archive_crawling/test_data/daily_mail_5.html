creative spark was starved of options.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">City dominated possession 66.1 per cent to 33.9 but that was mainly because Tottenham allowed them to have the ball while they

confidence of a similarly difficult challenge: preventing Hakim Ziyech from causing the sort of havoc he did when Sheffield United visited Stamford Bridge earlier in the month.</p><p
